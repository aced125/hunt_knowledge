The latest analysis, from a post hoc reading of two previously reported phase 3 trials, showed a twice-yearly injection of inclisiran—given to patients already taking their maximum-tolerated doses of statins—was able to lower LDL levels by an average of 54.1% after about a year and a half compared to placebo.

Join experts Prof. Gerhard Bauer and Catalent’s Dr. James Crutchley as they discuss challenges and an innovative methodology to commercially scale autologous therapies.    In addition, 88% of treated patients posted blood test results showing LDLs reduced by half at least once during the studies. At the same time, inclisiran demonstrated a safety profile similar to placebo—with nearly the same rates of high blood pressure and joint pain. "There remains an urgent need for innovative LDL-C-lowering therapies for patients not reaching their LDL-C target goals with current standard of care,” David Soergel, Novartis’ global head of cardiovascular, renal and metabolic drug development, said in a statement. "With a unique twice-yearly dosing, if approved, inclisiran may fit seamlessly into patients\' regular healthcare visits and help us reimagine treatment for [artherosclerotic cardiovascular disease]." The results were presented at the annual congress of the European Society of Cardiology. Data from the same two trials, Orion-10 and Orion-11, were\xa0revealed earlier this year during the American College of Cardiology’s scientific meeting, demonstrating durable reductions in LDL cholesterol when used with other lipid-lowering therapies. RELATED: Novartis\' cholesterol buster, new trial starts fall victim to pandemic However, a new phase 3 study, dubbed Orion-4, was forced to pause enrollment as the novel coronavirus spread across the globe this year. It was slated to recruit 15,000 participants in the U.S. and U.K. and follow inclisiran’s long-term outcomes through at least 2024. The drug is also currently undergoing review by the European Medicines Agency. Inclisiran consists of small pieces of double-stranded RNA that interfere with the expression of genes for the protein PCSK9, which is linked to the accumulation of bad cholesterol in the bloodstream. "This analysis confirms that as a small interfering RNA, inclisiran provides a remarkably consistent treatment profile,” said Orion-11 principal investigator Kausik Ray, a professor of public health at Imperial College London. “Nearly all patients from these trials achieved clinically meaningful reductions of their LDL-C levels over the 17-month period, and inclisiran had a safety and tolerability profile similar to placebo."\xa0 Novartis said it plans to present additional findings at the upcoming meetings of the American Heart Association and the European Atherosclerosis Society as it prepares for inclisiran’s commercial launch in the U.S. and Europe, pending approvals.

The U.K. Big Pharma said its phase 2a test of GSK3228836, which works as an antisense oligonucleotide, showed “marked reductions” in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), one of the key biomarkers of the disease, as well as its viral DNA when pitted against placebo. This was after four weeks of treatment in people with chronic hep B on stable nucleoside or nucleotide analogue (NA) therapy, as well as those who had not had the treatment, which is a standard of care for the disease.

Join experts Prof. Gerhard Bauer and Catalent’s Dr. James Crutchley as they discuss challenges and an innovative methodology to commercially scale autologous therapies.    Drilling down into the numbers, GSK said the group given its drug with an NA therapy (which was four patients) saw a numerically greater average [SD] reduction of -2.51 [1.57] log10 IU/ml vs. placebo -0.01 [0.04], n=2, p=0.45 was hit, though the p-values were edging toward not being statistically significant. \xa0 Three of these patients had reductions ≥3.0 log10 IU/mL by Day 29, while one additional patient discontinued at Day 4 “and was not included in the analysis,” according to the London-based pharma.  In those not treated alongside NA therapy (n=12), average [SD] reduction reached -1.56 [1.38] log10 IU/ml vs. placebo 0.00 [0.11], n=6, p=0.001. Three of these patients had reductions ≥3.0 log10 IU/mL by Day 29. Across both treatment groups, of the six patients with HBsAg reductions >3.0 log10 IU/ml, four patients had levels falling below the limit of quantification (0.05 IU/ml). Prolonged HBsAg loss was observed in one-NA treated patient (from Day 36 to Day 113) and one NA-naïve patient (from Day 23 to Day 126). Reductions in the DNA on the virus was >2 log10 IU/mL in five of 12 NA-naïve patients, while in the the NA-naïve group (n=12), average [SD] reduction reached -1.66 [1.48] log10 IU/ml vs. placebo 0.00 [0.47], n=6, p<0.001. GSK said its drug was now “on track” to start a phase 2b program “by the end of 2020.” There was a safety scare after one patient suffered a liver enzyme elevation that was classified as a serious adverse event, although this self-resolved. Safety will continue to be a major issue for all developers, although the RNA data are so far pretty clean at the ILC.  While the use of antisense oligonucleotide technology is being used across several therapy areas, including CNS disorders, its use in hep B is fairly novel and not without its troubles. Roche was tapping the same tech with its RG6004 in hep B, moving the drug into the clinic back in 2017 but then dumping the program at the start of this year. It promptly signed a pact with Dicerna Pharmaceuticals based on its early-stage work on an RNAi approach to the disease. This appears to be the favored method, with Vir and partner Alnylam as well as Arrowhead and partner J&J also presenting data at ILC 2020 showing they could also hit prolonged HBsAg loss.  RELATED: ILC: Searching for a functional cure while battling rivals, Vir and Alnylam post hep B data peek “Chronic hepatitis B affects around 260 million people globally and, despite existing treatments, can lead to nearly 900,000 deaths per year due to liver failure and liver cancer,” said Christopher Corsico, senior vice president of development at GSK.  “We have observed promising early-stage results showing antiviral activity with our anti-sense oligonucleotide, a key investigational medicine in our growing infectious diseases portfolio. This marks a potential step forward toward the goal of assessing sustained functional cure for people with chronic hepatitis B.” '}, {'id': '4c8a5f90-ec1f-11ea-8093-fdd8c08b34d7', '__typename': 'Article', 'createdAt': '2020-09-01T06:49:36.049Z', 'updatedAt': '2020-09-01T06:49:36.049Z', 'mercuryObj': {'title': "Unum's CAR-T tech—and research team—lands at Czech biotech Sotio for $8.1M", 'author': None, 'date_published': None, 'dek': None, 'lead_image_url': 'https://qtxasset.com/fiercebiotech/1598833076/agreement-3489902_1280.jpg/agreement-3489902_1280.jpg?4j5QluhSSdH9sPXnrJOjzWe76K5rQQS_', 'next_page_url': None, 'url': 'https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/unum-s-car-t-tech-and-research-team-lands-at-czech-biotech-sotio-for-8-1m', 'domain': 'www.fiercebiotech.com', 'excerpt': 'It’s no secret that Unum Therapeutics has had a tough run—in March, the company cut more than half its staff and wound down its clinical work in a bid to shore up a preclinical CAR-T prospect.

Now, that program, along with the technology behind it, has found a new home: Sotio, a Prague-based biotech developing multiple types of cancer treatments. Sotio is handing over $8.1 million upfront for Unum’s BOXR CAR-T platform and its lead programs, including BOXR1030, a treatment Unum had been developing for liver cancer and other solid tumors. The Czech biotech will pick up where Unum left off with plans to build on its data to bring the candidate into the clinic in 2021. And, if all goes to plan, Unum’s shareholders could net another $3.4 million in milestones down the line. That’s not all Sotio is getting from Unum—it’s recruited several team members who built the BOXR technology, including Unum’s former chief technology officer, Geoff Hodge, and it has acquired “a portion of its laboratory and manufacturing facility” in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

RELATED: Unum dumps clinical work, slashes 60% of workforce as CSO walks “For us, this was a critical thing,” Sotio CEO Radek Špíšek, Ph.D., said. “I believe that in order to rebuild the BOXR program and move forward quickly to the clinic, we need to build on the expertise built in Unum.” To start the BOXR1030 program back up, Sotio thought it necessary to rebuild the organization that had started it, Špíšek added. The BOXR, or Bolt-On Chimeric Receptor, technology uses “bolt-on” transgenes to boost T-cell function in the microenvironment of solid tumors, which usually suppresses T-cell attacks. In preclinical studies, BOXR1030 T cells expressing a “bolt-on” gene and a glypican-3 (GPC3)-targeted CAR fared better than traditional GPC3-targeted CAR-T cells in tumor microenvironment-like conditions. RELATED: Days after wielding the ax, Unum hit with clinical hold, again Backed by PPF Group, Sotio was founded in 2010 around a dendritic cell-based immune-oncology program. Along the way, it added other types of programs to its pipeline, including a pair of IL-15 superagonists designed to surmount challenges that limit interleukin approaches, and antibody-drug conjugates, which take advantage of the selective nature of antibodies to deliver cell-killing drugs to tumors. It was already on the hunt for a CAR-T program when, in a “lucky coincidence,” Unum came along. “Our approach from the beginning has been to focus on CAR-T programs trying to crack the solid tumor field,” Špíšek said. Sotio figured it was too late to play catch-up to the established players in blood cancer. “Out of all the CAR-T programs we reviewed—and there were many—we were very much intrigued by the preclinical efficacy data and rationale for the BOXR platform that Unum had,” he added.

In the latest study—dubbed Explorer-HCM, one of the largest in the disease—the once-daily drug showed statistically significant improvements in heart function and oxygen consumption after 30 weeks, with 36.6% of treated patients meeting that mark compared with\xa017.2% of those who received a placebo.

Patients treated with mavacamten also reported that they could exercise more and generally felt better, with improvements in shortness of breath and other quality of life scores. RELATED: MyoKardia\'s mavacamten reduces heart stress signs in targeted biomarker study “Every aspect of objective performance and subjective well-being improved on the treatment,” Iacopo Olivotto,\xa0the study’s lead clinical investigator, said in a press conference during the European Society of Cardiology\'s virtual annual meeting, where the data were unveiled. At the same time, mavacamten was generally well tolerated, with similar rates of serious side effects. MyoKardia said the Explorer-HCM data will form the basis of its submission to the FDA, slated for the first quarter of next year. The study\'s results were also published in The Lancet. In March, at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology, the company presented phase 2 data showing mavacamten could significantly reduce blood levels of cardiac troponin I and\xa0N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, or NT-proBNP—two proteins that signal\xa0the muscles of the heart wall are under damaging stress—among\xa0patients with non-obstructive HCM. Similar reductions were seen in the Explorer study. MyoKardia plans to pursue additional studies in the\xa0separate non-obstructive indication in the future, along with supplementary FDA filings. Thickening of the heart muscle and obstructions\xa0can lead to chest pain, palpitations, fatigue, lightheadedness or fainting, though some people may show no symptoms at all. Left untreated, the condition can progress into heart failure and require interventions such as ablation or open surgery. Mavacamten acts as a myosin inhibitor, disengaging a number of the cellular motors within the heart’s muscle tissue that drive contractions. By tailoring the amount of drug given, MyoKardia aims to apply a molecular brake on the strength of each heartbeat—enough to reduce the excessive forces that may constrict certain valves, but not too much that the heart can’t pump blood out to the body. This also makes it easier for the heart to relax, refill with blood and beat more efficiently. "Mavacamten is the first therapeutic candidate to target the heart muscle proteins that drive the excessive contractility and impaired relaxation that are\xa0hallmarks of HCM with the intent of correcting the abnormal function of the heart,"\xa0Daniel Jacoby, a study investigator and\xa0director of the heart failure program\xa0at the Yale School of Medicine, said in a statement. RELATED: After 4 years, it’s a no from Sanofi as it punts MyoKardia drug program deal Whether mavacamten can spare\xa0patients from\xa0surgical procedures, though, remains to be seen.\xa0That question will be tackled in a separate trial, Valor-HCM, which began dosing its first patient earlier this month. The company estimates that 1,500 people annually\xa0in the U.S. undergo surgery to relieve obstructions of the heart\'s left ventricle. But to the drug\'s\xa0credit, the majority of the patients in the Explorer\xa0study did not qualify for surgery or have an immediate need, illustrating the ability of mavacamten to offer an earlier and broader therapy option to HCM patients, Olivotto said.

It’s not letting those efforts go to waste, though—in studies presented at this year’s virtual International Liver Congress, Gilead and partner PathAI suggest improvements to NASH drug development. Those include the development of combination treatments for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), as well as the use of machine learning methods to assess liver biopsy images, currently the gold standard for diagnosing NASH. Gilead presented full data from ATLAS, a phase 2b study that tested firsocostat, an ACC inhibitor, and cilofexor, an FXR agonist, alone and in combination with each other, as well as with selonsertib, the ASK1 inhibitor that failed two phase 3 studies last year.

Catalent presents a clinical-to-commercial perspective on autologous therapies. Join experts Prof. Gerhard Bauer and Catalent’s Dr. James Crutchley as they discuss challenges and an innovative methodology to commercially scale autologous therapies.    The cilofexor-firsocostat combination performed the best on the primary endpoint, cutting liver scarring without worsening of NASH in 21% of patients with advanced fibrosis, but it did not beat placebo by a wide enough margin to be considered a success. Rohit Loomba, M.D., who presented the results said that might be a result to the small study size. RELATED: ILC: Searching for a functional cure while battling rivals, Vir and Alnylam post hep B data peek Drilling down, the study found the cilofexor-firsocostat combination did “significantly better” than placebo at reducing liver stiffness. After 48 weeks of treatment, 45% of patients taking the combo saw a 25% drop in liver stiffness measured by FibroScan, an ultrasound-based test, versus 20% of placebo patients. It also beat placebo at reducing biomarkers of fatty liver, including elevated liver enzymes and bile acids, as well as reducing liver inflammation (57% versus 29%), leading the investigators to suggest “future studies of combination therapies for advanced fibrosis due to NASH are warranted.” “There are two main reasons we think the combination approach may be optimal for this disease,” said Rob Myers, M.D., who leads fiver fibrosis clinical research at Gilead. “The first is the biology of the disease—there are multiple pathways at play; it is not simply a disease caused by one insult like a virus… The second reason is the NASH patient population is quite heterogenous and therefore it is likely that compounds that target one mechanism are more likely to benefit one population, while another mechanism might be better in a different population.” RELATED: 'Another swing, another miss' for Gilead as NASH combo flops in phase 2 Beyond pursuing treatments that hit multiple drivers of NASH, drugmakers in the space could benefit from improvements to liver biopsy. It’s no secret that liver biopsy is a subjective measure of disease—a pathologist’s findings depend on which part of the liver the sample was taken from and on the pathologist’s own experience. What’s more, findings can differ between pathologists and even the same pathologist can turn up different results on different days. Gilead and PathAI are working on machine learning approaches that can take this variability out of liver biopsy. The duo presented multiple posters showing that PathAI’s models could accurately and reproducibly assess markers of liver disease in biopsy images and predict which patients are likely to see their disease worsen. The models aren’t designed to solve other downsides of biopsy, such as their invasive nature, or the fact that they only consider a narrow slice of the liver: “We can’t solve the invasive part,” PathAI CEO Andy Beck said. “But we can extract as much medically useful information from each biopsy as possible using machine learning.” “In the context of ATLAS, the evaluated rates of fibrosis improvement based on central pathologists’ reading were not statistically significant… Using machine learning approaches, we were able to see a significant reduction in fibrosis, as well as a shift from advanced fibrosis patterns to less advanced fibrosis patterns,” Myers said. “It suggests we are indeed seeing a regression of fibrosis that perhaps is not being picked up by conventional staging because of insensitivity,” he added.

They’re already using such models, of course, but regulators still use traditional biopsy—that is, images read by humans—as the endpoint in NASH studies. PathAI is working with industry partners and the FDA to work toward incorporating machine learning in those NASH endpoints, Beck said. He hopes that machine learning will become the new standard for how pathology is measured within the next couple of years. As for Gilead’s NASH pipeline, the company is testing the cilofexor-firsocostat combo in tandem with Novo Nordisk’s GLP-1 drug semaglutide. “We continue to analyze the data from the ATLAS study, as well as other ongoing studies we have, for example, our study collaboration with Novo Nordisk,” Myers said. “We continue to evaluate those data and discuss with regulators the optimal path forward for these therapies.” "}, {'id': '4dd6741b-ec1f-11ea-8093-fdd8c08b34d7', '__typename': 'Article', 'createdAt': '2020-09-01T06:49:39.035Z', 'updatedAt': '2020-09-01T06:49:39.035Z', 'mercuryObj': {'title': "Novartis targets Alexion's fiefdom after showing PNH patients can safely switch from Soliris", 'author': None, 'date_published': None, 'dek': None, 'lead_image_url': 'https://qtxasset.com/fiercebiotech/1598874669/Novartis.jpg/Novartis.jpg?xo6tFWmNevwyzD3TBNb5eTjRub1ERXEm', 'next_page_url': None, 'url': 'https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/novartis-targets-alexion-s-fiefdom-after-showing-pnh-patients-can-safely-switch-from', 'domain': 'www.fiercebiotech.com', 'excerpt': 'Novartis has presented midphase data showing paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria patients can safely transition from Alexion’s Soliris to its experimental oral candidate LNP023.', 'word_count': 493, 'direction': 'ltr', 'total_pages': 1, 'rendered_pages': 1, 'source': 'www.fiercebiotech.com'}, 'url': 'https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/novartis-targets-alexion-s-fiefdom-after-showing-pnh-patients-can-safely-switch-from', 'category': 'pharma', 'subcategory': 'biotech', 'absSum': None, 'title': "Novartis targets Alexion's fiefdom after showing PNH patients can safely switch from Soliris", 'source': 'www.fiercebiotech.com', 'text': 'Novartis has presented midphase data showing paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) patients can safely transition from Alexion’s Soliris to its experimental oral candidate LNP023. The open-label phase 2 evaluated the effect of adding LNP023, Novartis’ small-molecule inhibitor of the alternative complement pathway, to the standard of care in PNH patients. The trial was mainly designed to assess whether daily dosing of LNP023 on top of PNH standard of care, namely Alexion’s blockbuster intravenous infusion Soliris, reduces chronic hemolysis over the first 13 weeks. Novartis emerged from the trial with data to support the use of LNP023 as an add-on therapy in PNH patients who have active hemolysis despite treatment with Soliris. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), the biomarker used to assess chronic hemolysis, fell significantly upon treatment with LNP023. The range of LDH declines after 13 weeks of treatment spanned from 34% to 81% across the 10-patient study. LDH at baseline was 539 U/L.

The researchers also tracked changes in hemoglobin levels, which rose by 2.87 g/dL from baseline. Eighty percent of the participants experienced transfusion-free hemoglobin normalization by week 13. Red blood cell populations increased. All the subjects required transfusions at baseline. After completing the 13-day study, all participants enrolled into an extension period that had tracked the participants for between 92 and 392 days as of the cutoff. No patients have required red blood cell transfusions.\xa0 The improvements led seven patients who had taken LNP023 for at least six months as an add-on therapy to discontinue Soliris. None of the patients who switched to taking LNP023 as a single agent suffered falls in hemoglobin, changes in biomarkers of disease activity or symptoms of breakthrough hemolysis. No participants suffered treatment-related serious adverse events or thromboembolic events prior to the cutoff date for the analysis. However, one participant has since stopped taking LNP023 after experiencing lymphoproliferative disorder. The serious adverse event happened in a patient who had severe lymphopenia when they enrolled in the clinical trial. Buoyed by the data, Novartis Chief Medical Officer John Tsai, M.D., discussed plans for further evaluations of LNP023 with a view to establishing the oral drug as a monotherapy and new standard of care in PNH. Novartis will face competition as it tries to muscle in on the PNH market. Alexion is building on the dominant position it established with Soliris by promoting its long-acting C5 inhibitor Ultomiris and developing oral factor D inhibitors ALXN2040 and ALXN2050 as an add-on therapy and single agent, respectively.\xa0 Apellis Pharmaceuticals is going after the market, too, with subcutaneous prospect pegcetacoplan, which outperformed Soliris in a phase 3 trial earlier this year. All of the contenders will likely need to compete with biosimilars in the coming years. After reaching a deal with Alexion, Amgen is clear to introduce a Soliris biosimilar in 2025.

One of those points is clinical trials, where this technology can make studies easier for patients and investigators to navigate, and ultimately help biopharma companies make the best drugs they can. The key is selecting the right tool for the job, said panelists during a Fierce AI Week discussion. “Artificial intelligence” in biopharma has become an umbrella term encompassing true AI, machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, biostatistics and data science. “For us at Janssen R&D, it really starts with the question when we look at the pipeline, the different medicines we are trying to build,” said Najat Khan, Ph.D., chief data science officer and global head of strategy and operations at Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen.   Catalent presents a clinical-to-commercial perspective on autologous therapies. Join experts Prof. Gerhard Bauer and Catalent’s Dr. James Crutchley as they discuss challenges and an innovative methodology to commercially scale autologous therapies.    “Once you have the question identified that’s pertinent for the program … then we say, what are all the different approaches we can use to actually answer that question?” she added. RELATED: How did Novo Nordisk's Sophia chatbot become a pharma industry standard? Empathy, timing and relevance: experts Some of those questions include how sponsors and investigators can make sure they’re using the right endpoints, or how studies can track disease progression, especially in diseases that may present in different ways in different people. In the latter case, study teams could be juggling various datasets, including genomic and imaging data to physician notes—and they’d need the right tool to fit the task. “It’s a broad range of capabilities; it’s not always the most sophisticated algorithm that will answer your question, but what is fit-for-purpose for the question you’re trying to answer,” Khan said. But that’s just one piece of the puzzle. Another part is how to build and train AI models so that they’re useful and not causing harm, said James Hamrick, senior medical director at Flatiron Health. “We are in many ways training a machine to simulate human intelligence, so the processes of learning and reasoning, as well as self-correction,” said Raolat Abdoulai, M.D., clinical research director at Sanofi. “We need to make sure we are providing it with appropriate information and data for it to learn from … either from past trials as well as data in the real world in order to make better, effective and more reasoned decisions,” Abdoulai added. Flatiron, for instance, has models that can predict whether a patient has metastatic disease, or if a patient is likely to be admitted to the emergency room during cancer treatment. “At the same time, we are retrospectively running a check on the model, looking at different categories of patients—so things like gender or ethnicity—and we are actively checking the model as we go to make sure it is in agreement and bias-free,” Hamrick said. “And what I mean by that is, the predictions we made two months ago—what happened in those two months? Were they accurate across these different subgroups of patients?” While drugmakers should make sure their models work for diverse patient populations, they may use other AI tools to ensure they enroll diverse patient populations in the first place, so there aren’t any nasty surprises when it rolls out the drug. “We’ve done that in some trials where we know that the disease impacts more diverse patients and our clinical trial participants should be reflective of the real-world setting… Instead of going to a site and asking, can you have this many diverse patients, you flip it around and say where are the diverse patients to begin with?” Khan said. RELATED: AI's hunt for the molecule to stop COVID-19 “In this way, we take away the bias that prevents patients from a diverse range of backgrounds from being recruited,” Abdoulai said. Beyond improving data analysis for drug development, AI tools, mobile or wearable devices and remote monitoring could also make open up clinical trials to people who perhaps don’t live close to a trial site or may not want to visit a site, especially during a pandemic. These tools could be the key to not just digitizing trials, but also decentralizing them. One plus would be bringing “the technology to the individual, the subject being recruited, to where they are and rather than bringing them to the clinic and subjecting them to analog, non-digital ways of acquiring data,” said Ajay Royyuru, IBM fellow and vice president of healthcare and life sciences at IBM. “We have digital health and ways of acquiring data remotely that actually lend themselves better to not only fairness, but also to AI-based analysis to continuously acquired data. This is beginning to occur, of course. Many digital biomarkers and digital endpoints are getting defined,” Royyuru added.

The company has simplified the device since its first unveiling last summer. It initially involved a small pod worn behind the outside of the ear, connected to separate electrodes strung up to the brain. The new version aims to fit entirely within the head, replacing a small cutout of the skull bone with a chip about the size of a coin. “In many ways it’s like a Fitbit in your skull, with tiny wires,” Musk said in the company’s livestream, as the device also aims to measure a person’s movement and body temperature as well as connect wirelessly to a smartphone.   Catalent presents a clinical-to-commercial perspective on autologous therapies. Join experts Prof. Gerhard Bauer and Catalent’s Dr. James Crutchley as they discuss challenges and an innovative methodology to commercially scale autologous therapies.    And these are very tiny wires—at about 5 microns wide, they’re slightly smaller than the diameter of your average red blood cell. These filaments are stitched into the brain by Neuralink’s surgical robot, which somewhat resembles a large, sterile sewing machine. It can connect up to 1,024 wires at a time, while working to avoid puncturing veins and arteries, to provide a higher-resolution view into neural activity than current technologies that may offer a few dozen channels. RELATED: Musk's Neuralink startup aims to connect brains to the web Musk said the whole procedure could take less than an hour, without general anesthesia. The objective is to build a robot that can perform the entire surgery itself, from the first cut to wiring to closing up. The company’s goal is to ultimately solve brain and spine problems—such as rejoining a disconnected or damaged brain with the motor muscles of the arms and legs—but it also hopes to one day address a broader array of neurological conditions such as depression, anxiety, seizures and memory loss, or even serve as a consumer product. However, the chip currently works in one direction, for the most part: It can observe and record neurons’ electrical activity, but the science behind transmitting intelligible signals back to the tissue to correct a disease—or even streaming music sans headphones, as Musk pitched—may be years away. In addition, mapping activity from different regions of the human brain to any specific behavior or motion is, at this point, less than clear. The early stages of this research were demonstrated with a pig named Gertrude, who has lived with a Neuralink implant for two months. She was able to light up a computer screen each time her snout smelled or touched something interesting, causing neurons to fire. Meanwhile, another pig, Dorothy, was implanted with the device but had it removed to show its reversibility. Neuralink also showed that, by putting a pig on a treadmill and tracing the movements of its joints, it could nearly predict the location of each limb as it walked by just using data gathered from the brain. Musk said the device received a breakthrough designation from the FDA in July, and the company is currently preparing for its first human implantations, pending regulatory approvals for a study and additional safety testing. To do so, Neuralink hopes to increase its staff. “The primary purpose of this demo is actually recruiting,” Musk said. “We’re not trying to raise money—the main purpose of this is to convince great people to come work at Neuralink, and help us bring this product to fruition.” RELATED: Synchron kicks off clinical trial for brain-machine interface—without drilling skulls Earlier the same day, the FDA granted a separate breakthrough designation to Synchron for its brain-computer interface, which forgoes the messier business of trepanning.

Join experts Prof. Gerhard Bauer and Catalent’s Dr. James Crutchley as they discuss challenges and an innovative methodology to commercially scale autologous therapies.    Anivive originally licensed the drug, called GC376, from Kansas State University in 2018 and has been working since then to develop it as an antiviral to treat FIP, a progressive disease in cats that’s often caused by a coronavirus and is fatal if left untreated. Last month, Anivive said it had started two preclinical studies to determine whether GC376 could also treat COVID-19. RELATED: COVID-19: New animal data back up Gilead's remdesivir as other treatment candidates emerge GC376 was designed to inhibit a protease called 3C, which promotes the replication of several coronaviruses that infect animals and people. They include feline coronavirus (FCoV), which usually causes mild symptoms in cats but can lead to FIP. Two pilot studies of GC376 in pet cats infected with FIP showed that the drug was effective against the disease within two weeks and was well tolerated. Anivive is currently scaling up production of the drug for larger studies in cats. For the new study, the University of Alberta team tested both GC376 and its parent drug, GC373, for their ability to inhibit the 3C protease. Both drugs blocked viral replication, they reported. The authors acknowledged that vaccines against COVID-19 are advancing rapidly, but they suggested antiviral drugs are still necessary in the short term. SARS-CoV-2 “is a virus with a significant mutation rate. Also, in some patients the virus has persisted longer than 2 months with some possibility of re-infection,” they wrote in the study. M. Joanne Lemieux, Ph.D., professor of structural biology at the University of Alberta, pointed out in an interview with Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News that GC376 could be advanced rapidly into human trials, given its track record in veterinary medicine. “Because this drug has already been used to treat cats with coronavirus, and it’s effective with little to no toxicity, it’s already passed [preclinical] stages, and this allows us to move forward,” Lemieux said.

Earlier this year, New Jersey-based Immunomedics’ first drug, an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) called Trodelvy (sacituzumab govitecan), was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for heavily pre-treated metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).\nSwiss pharma giant Roche has been supporting Immunomedics in the development of Trodelvy for TNBC. Now Immunomedics and Roche have expanded their collaboration to include two more solid tumour indications: metastatic urothelial cancer (UC) and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\nPromise of Trodelvy in UC and NSCLCTrodelvy targets Trop-2, a glycoprotein expressed on the surface of certain cancer types. As well as being highly expressed on breast cancer tumours, Trop-2 is also found on other cancer types, including UC and NSCLC.\nImmunomedics is conducting its own Phase II studies in UC and NSCLC; these trials have yielded promising results so far. The company’s chief business and financial officer Usama Malik states that in a metastatic UC trial, “Trodelvy produced an overall response rate (ORR) of 31%, with an encouraging median duration of response (DoR) of 12.6 months and median progression-free survival (PFS) and median overall survival (OS) of 7.3 months and 16.3 months, respectively.”“While in 54 heavily-pre-treated patients with metastatic NSCLC, the ORR was 19%, median DoR was 6.0 months, and median PFS and median OS was 5.2 months and 9.5 months, respectively,” adds Malik.\nCombining Trodelvy and TecentriqImmunomedics’ collaboration with Roche centres around the potential Trodelvy has as a “combination treatment when paired with the right complementary drugs” in these two indications, explains Malik. Roche and Immunomedics will be studying Trodelvy in combination with Roche’s anti- programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) checkpoint inhibitor, Tecentriq (atezolizumab), in two Phase Ib/II studies.\nCheckpoint inhibitors alone have struggled to keep ORRs low in metastatic UC and NSCLC. “People who have relapsed after, or are refractory to, platinum chemotherapy and the recently approved checkpoint inhibitor treatments have a significant unmet need with few treatment options available,” explains Malik. However, Roche and Immunomedics hope that combining Trodelvy and Tecentriq could help overcome that unmet need.\nMalik concludes: “Trodelvy can cause tumour-cell death with possible neoantigen release, combining it with Tecentriq, an immune-stimulating agent, could potentially create a synergistic effect.\n“Additionally, the two agents have very different mechanisms and non-overlapping adverse event profiles, making them good combination partners.” "}, {'id': '53feb17c-ec1f-11ea-8093-fdd8c08b34d7', '__typename': 'Article', 'createdAt': '2020-09-01T06:49:48.556Z', 'updatedAt': '2020-08-20T12:16:17.000Z', 'mercuryObj': {'title': 'Roche teams up with Regeneron on Covid-19 therapy', 'author': 'Divya Tirumalaraju', 'date_published': '2020-08-20T12:16:17.000Z', 'dek': None, 'lead_image_url': 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/02/pills_05feb.jpg', 'next_page_url': None, 'url': 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/roche-regeneron-covid-therapy/', 'domain': 'www.pharmaceutical-technology.com', 'excerpt': "Roche has partnered with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals to develop, manufacture and distribute the latter's REGN-COV2 as a potential treatment of Covid-19.", 'word_count': 376, 'direction': 'ltr', 'total_pages': 1, 'rendered_pages': 1, 'source': 'www.pharmaceutical-technology.com'}, 'url': 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/roche-regeneron-covid-therapy/', 'category': 'pharma', 'subcategory': None, 'absSum': None, 'title': 'Roche teams up with Regeneron on Covid-19 therapy', 'source': 'www.pharmaceutical-technology.com', 'text': "     Regeneron is working with the BARDA to develop monoclonal antibodies targeting the new coronavirus.

Roche has partnered with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals to develop, manufacture and distribute the latter’s antiviral antibody combination, REGN-COV2, as a potential treatment of Covid-19.\nREGN-COV2 could help treat patients with symptoms and also prevent the disease in individuals exposed to the virus.\nThe partners expect to boost the supply of the therapeutic by at least three and a half times the existing capacity and may expand even further.\nCurrently, the drug candidate is undergoing two Phase II / III clinical trials as a Covid-19 treatment and a Phase III trial to prevent the disease in household contacts of infected patients.\nIf clinical trials are successful and regulatory approvals obtained, Regeneron will distribute REGN-COV2 in the US, while Roche will distribute everywhere else.Roche Pharmaceuticals CEO Bill Anderson said: “We are excited about the potential for one medicine to serve both as a treatment for those infected as well as protection for people exposed to the virus.\n“We’re committing our manufacturing expertise and capacity, and our global distribution network to bring Regeneron’s potential antibody combination to as many people around the world as we possibly can.” Both companies dedicated certain manufacturing capacity to REGN-COV2 per year and already started the technology transfer process. Each party will be responsible for its own distribution costs in their designated territories.\nThe partners will together fund and execute the ongoing Phase III prevention and Phase I healthy volunteers safety studies, along with other global studies of the therapeutic in Covid-19 indication.\nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals president and CEO Leonard Schleifer said: “Regeneron has progressed the REGN-COV2 research and development programme at record speed and worked tirelessly to maximise our in-house manufacturing capacity.\n“This major collaboration with Roche provides important scale and global expertise to bring REGN-COV2 to many more patients in the US and around the globe.”\nRoche will principally carry out activities related to regulatory approvals outside the US, after the initial European Medicines Agency (EMA) authorisation.\nLast month, Regeneron received a $450m contract from the US for the manufacture and supply of REGN-COV2 against Covid-19.

New York-based Ovid Therapeutics and Italian firm Angelini Pharma have signed an agreement regarding the development, manufacturing and commercialisation of the former’s OV101 (gaboxadol) as a potential treatment for Angelman syndrome, a rare genetic disease, in the European Union (EU) and the wider European Economic Area (EEA).\nIn return for Angelini gaining responsibility for OV101’s future in Europe, Ovid will receive $20m as an upfront payment, and be eligible for an additional $212.5m in milestone payments related to the drug.\n“Through our collaboration with Ovid Therapeutics we are laying the foundation to developing innovative health solutions for rare disease,” states Angelini CEO Pierluigi Antonelli. “This is a new sector for Angelini Pharma, and in which we believe there are many opportunities for a company of our size.”\xa0 He adds that the work will be executed through Angelini’s new affiliate based in Switzerland, Angelini Pharma Rare Disease.\nThe need for partnership in EuropeOvid’s business strategy focuses on bringing new therapies to patients across the world as quickly as possible, therefore, “we want to ensure a rapid, coordinated, thoughtful and disciplined launch as rapidly as possible in all geographies”, says Ovid CEO and chairman Jeremy Levin. Therefore, Levin explains, as Ovid “began to accelerate our commercial preparation for our footprint in the USA,” the company decided to look to find a partner to launch “parallel preparations in Europe to ensure the most rapid coordinated launch of OV101 into the market.”Angelini is an excellent regional partner for Ovid in Europe because it is a “regional family-orientated company with an impeccable reputation and has several key critical attributes,” notes Levin. “These include the fact that they have deep EU regulatory and manufacturing expertise, EU operations and a clear strategic plan in rare diseases”.\n“We are very excited to have the opportunity to significantly contribute to the development, manufacturing and commercialisation of gaboxadol [OV101] in the EU, other countries in the EEA, and, also, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom and Russia,” Antonelli concludes. Overcoming challenges in Angelman syndromeAngelman syndrome is a historically misunderstood and complicated condition, which has deterred companies from developing drugs for this rare genetic disease. This has created a situation where “treatment has focused on individual symptom management”, such as with anti-seizure medications, explains Levin. Beyond seizures, the most common symptoms are intellectual disability, speech impairment and sleep disorders.\nOvid has tried to alter this treatment paradigm by looking at tackling the disease holistically through targeting “the pathways at the extra-synaptic\xa0gala\xa0receptor”. Levin explains the company developed OV101 to “address the underlying symptomology of the disease by activating GABAA\xa0receptor activity to restore\xa0tonic inhibition”, thereby targeting the main cause of the disease’s symptoms.\nThe drug “binds tightly to the unique extrasynaptic GABAA\xa0receptors on neurons throughout the brain, restoring the levels of tonic inhibition that exist when intrinsic GABAA\xa0levels are low”, says Levin.\nOV101 has demonstrated safety and efficacy in studies of Angelman syndrome patients to date. In the Phase II STARS trial, not only did OV101 have a favourable safety profile, it had a statistically significant effect compared to placebo on the overall symptoms of Angelman syndrome patients.\nNow Ovid is conducting a Phase III trial of OV101, dubbed NEPTUNE. The results are expected in the fourth quarter of this year, and it is hoped this data combined with the results of the STARS trial will form the basis of a marketing authorisation application to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nAs a result of its promise to overcome this unmet need in Angelman syndrome, both the FDA and the European Commission have granted OV101 rare or orphan disease designation in this condition.\nBeyond OV101Ovid’s commitment to Angelman syndrome does not end with OV101. This month the pharma company signed a deal with the University of Connecticut School of Medicine [UConn] to collaborate on developing a next-generation short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-based therapeutic.\nThe hope is that a gene therapy approach can address the underlying cause of Angelman disease: the loss of function of the gene that codes for ubiquitin protein ligase E3A, which leads to impaired tonic inhibition. It is possible that this shRNA approach could work synergistically alongside OV101 in addressing the symptoms of Angelman patients.\nOvid chief medical officer and president Amit Rakhit explained: “We believe OV101 has the potential to serve as a core therapy for this disorder and are now focused on building a comprehensive and strategic Angelman syndrome longer-term pipeline.\n“This collaboration with Drs. Chamberlain and Germain [at UConn], both accomplished scientific leaders in the field of Angelman syndrome, will enable us to accelerate and share in their mission to identify and develop next-generation genetic therapies.” "}, {'id': '582a5076-ec1f-11ea-8093-fdd8c08b34d7', '__typename': 'Article', 'createdAt': '2020-09-01T06:49:55.552Z', 'updatedAt': '2020-09-01T06:49:55.552Z', 'mercuryObj': {'statusCode': 200, 'url': 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/leo-pharma-cheplapharm-deal/', 'images': ['https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2017/09/pharma-technology-logo.png', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2017/09/pharma-technology-logo-mobile.png', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2017/09/logo-151.jpg', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2017/09/logo-151.jpg', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2016/02/iStock-491061581.jpg', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2017/09/main-98.jpg', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/04/PTI-only-100px.jpg', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/04/PTI-only-100px.jpg', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/10/alpex-logo.png', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/10/alpex-logo.png', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2017/09/main-209.jpg', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2017/09/main-154.jpg', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/05/Create-pop-up-3.jpg', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/05/Tech-pop-up-3.jpg', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/05/life-sciences-pop-up-3.jpg'], 'title': 'LEO Pharma divests four medicines to Cheplapharm for $357m', 'excerpt': 'Danish company LEO Pharma has divested a portfolio of four non-core medicines to German pharmaceutical firm Cheplapharm for €300m ($357m).', 'source': 'www.pharmaceutical-technology.com', 'domain': 'www.pharmaceutical-technology.com'}, 'url': 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/leo-pharma-cheplapharm-deal/', 'category': 'pharma', 'subcategory': None, 'absSum': None, 'title': 'LEO Pharma divests four medicines to Cheplapharm for $357m', 'source': 'www.pharmaceutical-technology.com', 'text': "The deal is in line with LEO Pharma’s 2030 strategy to boost its focus on new medical dermatology solutions.

Credit: Librepath via Wikimedia.     Sign up here for GlobalData's free bi-weekly Covid-19 report on the latest information your industry needs to know.  Precision therapy company Blueprint Medicines has signed a global collaboration with Roche and its subsidiary Genentech.\nThe partnership focuses on developing and commercialising Blueprint’s personalised therapy pralsetinib in cancers driven by oncogenic RET alterations. These include non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and medullary thyroid cancer. In addition, Roche and Blueprint will work together to expand the development of pralsetinib to other treatment settings and research additional RET inhibitors.\n“While RET-activating fusions and mutations are key disease drivers in many cancer types, including NSCLC and MTC, current treatment options that selectively target these alterations are limited,” notes a spokesperson for Roche. “We are very excited to enter into this collaboration with Blueprint Medicines with the goal of bringing a potentially transformative new treatment option to patients with this rare type of RET-altered cancers as quickly as possible.”\nTerms of the agreement between Blueprint and RocheBlueprint will receive $775m in upfront payments from Roche; $100m of this comes in the form of an equity investment in Blueprint’s common stock. Blueprint will also be eligible for up to $927m in contingent payments related to sales and regulatory milestones. While Blueprint and Genentech will co-commercialise the drug in the US, Roche will obtain exclusive rights for pralsetinib outside of the US, except Greater China. Blueprint will be eligible for tiered royalty payments for net sales of the drug outside of the US.CStone Pharmaceuticals will retain all development and commercialisation rights to pralsetinib in Greater China, according to the terms of a previous collaboration with Blueprint.\nThis $775m funding will allow Blueprint to “expand investment in our broad precision medicine pipeline and a path to financial independence,” notes company spokesperson, Andrew Law. Blueprint plans to continue to expand the development of pralsetinib across various indications, as well as continuing to accelerate its rare disease programmes, such as systemic mastocytosis, Law adds. Need for precision medicine to treat RET-altered cancers“Current treatment of RET-altered cancers is generally limited to drugs called multi-kinase inhibitors, which non-selectively inhibit a range of targets at once, and chemotherapy, which often have limited efficacy and carry significant off-target toxicities,” notes Law. “In addition, frequent dose modification or interruption due to off-target toxicities limits the opportunity for sustained response.”\nInstead, Blueprint hopes to improve the treatment paradigm with its “medicines that precisely target the genetic causes of cancer and rare diseases”, with the aim of providing “targeted therapies to patients most likely to benefit from them”, explains Law. To this end, the company has filed a new drug application to the US Food and Drug Administration for pralsetinib for the treatment of RET-altered NSCLC and thyroid cancers.\nThe idea is that a precision therapy, such as pralsetinib, will “selectively target oncogenic RET alterations, with the goal of enabling durable clinical benefit and a favourable safety profile,” Law explains.\nNot only does pralsetinib target certain genetic RET alterations that cause the tumours, Law notes “it was also built to inhibit additional mutations that occur over time and make cancer resistant to treatment. The purpose of this design was to provide patients with long-lasting benefits”.\nA Roche spokesperson adds: “Based on clinical data available to date, the depth of response has been very encouraging, with a complete response rate in NSCLC patients that is uncommon in advanced cancer and differentiated from other RET inhibitors.” Pralsetinib was also well tolerated in this cancer type.\nBuilding on Roche’s oncology work“Roche has unmatched capabilities to use data and diagnostics to identify patients based on the specific characteristics of their tumours,” states Law. This support Blueprint by using “data and diagnostics to identify patients based on the specific characteristics of their tumours” and mean pralsetinib can be brought to “patients in need around the world more quickly”.\nLaw adds: “These capabilities, combined with their broad experience in targeted cancer therapies, including multiple therapies for lung cancer, make Roche a perfect partner.”\nLaw notes that Roche has been leading the way with personalised therapies for cancer and other diseases for the past 20 years. This expertise will be useful to Blueprint as they “realize the value pralsetinib can bring to patients”.\nPralsetinib further complements Roche’s work in “finding treatment options for cancer patients based on certain genomic mutations, irrespective of the tumour site of origin.”\nA Roche spokesperson agrees, stating: “Pralsetinib represents an attractive opportunity for Roche to broaden and strengthen its oncology portfolio globally.\n“With our commercial expertise and reach in the oncology market and our experience with diagnostics and personalised healthcare, as well as our capabilities in the use of real-world data we are ideally placed to bring this new treatment option to patients, to address the unmet medical need.”\nBlueprint’s latest partnership with Roche expands upon a 2016 collaboration. This partnership focused on “identifying proteins called immunokinases that play a role in antitumor immune responses inside the cell, and precisely targeting them with small molecule therapies,” explains Law. The pair announced in November promising preclinical data for a programme targeting MAP4K1 and they are continuing to “advance three additional programs through different stages of discovery”.

Credit: Shutterstock.     Sign up here for GlobalData's free bi-weekly Covid-19 report on the latest information your industry needs to know.  Gene therapy specialist Forge Biologics has raised $40m in Series A round. This fundraising was led by early stage-focused Perceptive Xontogeny Venture Fund (PXV Fund); as a result, the fund’s manager, Chris Garabedian, will join Forge’s board of directors as chairman. Drive Capital also participated in the round.\nForge is differentiated from other players in the field because it is both a contract development and manufacturing organisation (CDMO) and performs its own research and development (R&D). The company has its own pipeline of three novel gene therapy products and provides advanced, current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) capabilities through its production facility, called The Hearth.\nThe company’s CEO, co-founder and president Tim Miller explains that the $40m funding will be “used to expand CDMO capacity to deliver GMP adeno-associated viruses (AAV) product for clients by mid-2021 and to develop a proprietary pipeline of novel gene therapies”.\nExploring Forge’s hybrid gene therapy engine“Forge is a true gene therapy development engine, bringing together access to quality, in-house manufacturing, the experience of our team in gene therapy product development, and an exciting pipeline of new therapies for patients,” explains Miller. The rationale behind the company’s hybrid model, Miller adds, was that “we saw a gap between the growth of the industry’s gene therapy pipeline and its capacity to manufacture the treatments”.This model allows Forge to “help secure the needs of additional clients, serving as an end-to-end solution provider, but also being able to support our own novel programs and build out our pipeline through that engine capacity,” Miller notes.\nThe PXV Fund was drawn to Forge’s combination approach. “The demand for such capabilities in the gene therapy field is still exceeding the supply, particularly as it relates to cGMP product through commercial scale,” says Garabedian. “We felt it made for a very compelling business model.” The significant experience of the leadership team was another factor in the PXV Fund’s decision to invest. “Many early-stage gene therapy technologies are looking for a home with an experienced team to lead the development, but also need access and capacity from a capable CDMO,” says Garbedian.\nForge and Krabbe diseaseAs it revealed the closure of its Series A round, Forge announced the target indication of its first gene therapy candidate. Its lead programme, FBX-101, is a novel AAV and umbilical cord transplant approach to treat Krabbe disease – the candidate is currently progressing into Phase I/II development.\nKrabbe disease is a rare, paediatric neurodegenerative condition that causes a loss of function associated with the galactosylceramidase (GALC) gene. This leads to accumulation of the lipid psychosine to toxic levels in cells, and particularly in those cells surrounding the nerves in the brain.\nFBX-101 works by delivering “GALC to cells in both the central and peripheral nervous system”, thereby functionally correcting “the central and peripheral neuropathy and… the behavioural impairments associated with Krabbe disease”, notes Miller.\nThis mechanism of action drastically improves upon the standard of care in Krabbe disease – a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Miller explains that although HSCT has led to the stabilisation of symptoms, it does not correct the GALC deficiency in the peripheral nervous system, so disease progression is not halted indefinitely.\nIn addition, combining the AAV gene therapy with an umbilical cord transplant helps to “overcome some of the immunological safety challenges of traditional AAV gene therapies”, according to Miller.\nForge is also working on two other proprietary AAV gene therapy programmes – FBX-201 and FBX-301 – which are currently in earlier stages of pre-clinical development. The precise indications of these two programmes have not yet been announced by Forge, but FBX-201 is for a rare monogenic disease, while FBX-301 is being developed for a rare cancer.

Credit: Nephron via Wikimedia Commons.     Sign up here for GlobalData's free bi-weekly Covid-19 report on the latest information your industry needs to know.  Philadelphia-based Imvax has raised $112m in a Series C round led by existing investor HP Wild Holding and supported by other major shareholders: Ziff Capital Partners, Magnetar Capital, and TLP Investment Partners. New investor Invus also participated in the funding round.\nImvax plans to use this funding “to continue clinical development of our lead product candidate, IGV-001, for treatment of glioblastoma through Phase 2, initiate the preclinical work and investigational new drug-enabling activities in additional oncology indications, as well as further expand Imvax’s core capabilities in research, development and manufacturing,” explains the company’s CEO John Furey.\nFurey adds the financing will also allow Imax to “strengthen our corporate infrastructure, particularly in legal, business development and human resources”.\nImvax co-founder and chairman of the board Peter Corr noted in a statement: “We are pleased to receive strong support from our existing and new investors who are aligned with Imvax’s mission to transform the current treatment regimen for glioblastoma and potentially other solid tumour cancers with a unique approach that focuses on long-term survival.” Imvax’s multi-antigen targeting approachFocused on developing innovative immunotherapy approaches for hard-to-treat solid tumours, Imvax has developed a “first-of-its-kind technology to personalise immunotherapy” to the benefit of patients, explains Furey.“The essence of Imvax’s drug candidates is a multi-antigen approach [that leverages] the patient’s own unique multi-antigen tumour profile, telling the body where and what to fight,” he adds. “The resulting systemic, long-lasting immune response specifically targets the tumour’s entire antigen profile, while simultaneously nullifying its immune-silencing ability.”\nThis more complete immune response is further supported by the addition of an antisense molecule, further differentiating Imvax’s drugs from other personalised immunotherapy approaches. Furey argues Imvax’s immunotherapy significantly improves upon a single-antigen or single-target approaches, which “poorly address individual patient variation, so have largely been unsuccessful. Because every cancer follows its own unique evolutionary path, we believe a multi-antigen-target approach is critical to success”.\nImvax, IGV-001 and glioblastomaGlioblastoma is a common and aggressive form of brain cancer, accounting for just over half of all primary brain tumours. The current standard of care has had limited success; median overall survival (OS) for patients remains between 14 and 16 months.\nHowever, results from a Phase Ib trial show that Imvax’s novel immunotherapy IGV-001 significantly outperformed the standard of care and prolonged both OS and progression-free survival (PFS) in newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients. Furey sees these promising results, revealed in March 2019, as central to Imvax’s recent successful financing round.\nIGV-001 is an autologous, or personalised, tumour vaccine, which is produced by harvesting living tumour cells from a patient, and treating them with “an insulin-like growth factor type 1 receptor (IGF-1R) antisense oligonucleotide (called IMV-001) to silence it, as IGF-1 is linked to tumour growth and metastasis,” notes Furey.\n“These interventions stress the cells as they are re-introduced to the patient, where an immunogenic cell death takes place,” Furey adds. “This leads to a controlled release of immunostimulatory antigens triggering a broad anti-tumour response and excess IGV-001 acts as an adjuvant to trigger an innate immune system response.”\nAlthough launching a Phase II trial of IGV-001 early next year is Imvax’s focus right now, the company is also investigating whether its multi-antigen approach will be effective in other solid tumours. Furey expects clinical studies of the next tumour type to also start in 2021.

Credit: Sarahkayb via Wikimedia.     Sign up here for GlobalData's free bi-weekly Covid-19 report on the latest information your industry needs to know.  Anglo-Swedish pharma giant AstraZeneca has entered into a global development and commercialisation agreement with Tokyo-headquartered Daiichi Sankyo for the latter’s TROP2 antibody drug conjugate (ADC) DS-1062.\nCreated using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, DS-1062 is currently in Phase I development for heavily pre-treated patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). NSCLC and breast cancers express Trop2 and are tumour types that have been a strategic focus for AstraZeneca.\nAccording to the terms of the agreement, Daiichi Sankyo will receive $1bn in staged payments from AstraZeneca. The Japanese company will also be eligible for up to $1bn for regulatory milestones and $4bn for sales-related milestones.\nThe global agreement excludes Japan, where Daiichi Sankyo will retain exclusive rights to DS-1062 and will pay AstraZeneca mid-single-digit royalties. “This deal will allow Daiichi Sankyo, together with AstraZeneca, to optimise the allocation of resources needed to maximize DS-1062 over the next five-year business plan and beyond,” notes Daiichi Sankyo’s senior vice-president and global head of oncology development Gilles Gallant.Gallant adds that the agreement will also support Daiichi Sankyo’s other DXd ADCs by allowing the company to “optimise the allocation of resources needed to maximize our third\xa0lead ADC, U3-1402,” as well as move other products, such as DS-7300 and DS-6157, forward over the next five years.\nDaiichi Sankyo’s ADC DS-1062ADCs involve three components: a monoclonal antibody modified to specifically target a certain antigen, a highly potent chemotherapy agent and a linker. The concept behind the drugs is that they deliver chemotherapy selectively to cancer cells and, therefore, avoid the side effects normally associated with chemotherapy. Daiichi Sankyo’s DXd technology optimises ADCs through both the chemotherapy payload and the linker.\xa0 According to Gallant, the company’s ADCs, including DS-1062, use a topoisomerase I inhibitor, which is believed to have a novel mechanism of action against several tumour types. This payload has high potency, membrane permeability and reduces systemic exposure to the payload.\nDS-1062 also relies upon a highly stable tetrapeptide-based linker, which “exhibits high in vitro plasma stability, designed to limit non-cancerous, normal tissue exposure to the payload,” explains Gallant.\nThe monoclonal antibody used in DS-1062 is a humanised anti-TROP2, a cell-surface glycoprotein.\n“TROP2 is overexpressed in many cancers including up to 80% of triple negative breast cancers,” Gallant says. “High TROP2 expression has also been identified in a majority of patients with NSCLC. TROP2 is recognised as a promising molecular target for therapeutic development in various cancers.”\nDaiichi Sankyo’s DXd technology allows the adjustment of the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR). Gallant notes that DS-1062 has a DAR of four “to optimise the benefit-risk ratio for the intended patient population.”\nSo far, DS-1062 has performed well in both preclinical and clinical studies for various TROP2 positive tumours. “We see significant potential in this antibody drug conjugate in lung as well as in breast and other cancers that commonly express TROP2,” said AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot in a statement. Gallant particularly picks out its promise in TNBC, a cancer with limited treatment options.\nBuilding on Enhertu partnershipThis latest deal represents AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo’s second ADC partnership. The first ADC deal centred around Enhertu (trastuzumab deruxtecan), previously known as DS-8201, a HER2 directed DXd ADC. The agreement was signed in March 2019 and saw AstraZeneca pay $1.35bn upfront to Daiichi Sankyo. The Japanese company was also eligible for $5bn in contingent payments and $1.75bn in sales-related milestones.\nEnhertu was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in December 2019 for patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received at least two prior anti-HER2 based regimens in the metastatic setting. This approval was based on the clinically meaningful and durable responses Enhertu showed in this patient population in a Phase II trial.\n“We are delighted to enter this new collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo and to build on the successful launch of Enhertu to further expand our pipeline and leadership in oncology,” noted Soriot in a statement.\n“Due to our existing collaboration with AstraZeneca for Enhertu, and its strong heritage in oncology, AstraZeneca presented itself to be an excellent collaborator for DS-1062,” concludes Gallant. “Daiichi Sankyo looks forward to another strong collaboration with AstraZeneca to help us to further our mission to translate innovative science into meaningful treatments for patients with cancer across the globe.” "}, {'id': '6bcf8f2e-ec1f-11ea-8093-fdd8c08b34d7', '__typename': 'Article', 'createdAt': '2020-09-01T06:50:28.512Z', 'updatedAt': '2020-08-10T08:30:02.000Z', 'mercuryObj': {'title': 'Tackling COPD: Verona raises $200m in a private placement', 'author': 'Allie Nawrat', 'date_published': '2020-08-10T08:30:02.000Z', 'dek': None, 'lead_image_url': 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/07/verona.jpg', 'next_page_url': None, 'url': 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/features/verona-copd-private-placement/', 'domain': 'www.pharmaceutical-technology.com', 'excerpt': 'To support advancing ensifentrine into COPD Phase III trials later this year, Verona raised $200m in a private placement from new and existing investors.', 'word_count': 665, 'direction': 'ltr', 'total_pages': 1, 'rendered_pages': 1, 'source': 'www.pharmaceutical-technology.com'}, 'url': 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/features/verona-copd-private-placement/', 'category': 'pharma', 'subcategory': None, 'absSum': None, 'title': 'Tackling COPD: Verona raises $200m in a private placement', 'source': 'www.pharmaceutical-technology.com', 'text': "     Verona will use the financing to support further development of its nebulised COPD drug ensifentrine. Credit: Shutterstock.     Sign up here for GlobalData's free bi-weekly Covid-19 report on the latest information your industry needs to know.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) specialist Verona Pharma has closed an oversubscribed private placement and subscription with $200m raised from existing and new investors.\nOnce agency fees and other expenses are dealt with, the net proceeds of the placement are estimated to be around $183m.\nThe financing was led by new investors – RA Capital Management, Access Biotechnology, Perceptive Advisors, Acorn Bioventures, PBM Capital, Samsara BioCapital, Foresite Capital, Sphera, Fairmount and Soleus Capital. Novo Holdings, Vivo Capital and other existing investors also participated in the placement.\nCommenting on this financing, Verona CEO David Zaccardelli says: “It is great to retain this expertise and to expand on it by adding additional support from new investors who also have deep knowledge of investing in drug development.” Verona is a public company listed on Nasdaq and the London Stock Exchange’s AIM, which means it is more typical to raise funds through “private placements of debt or stock”, rather than through series rounds, explains Zaccardelli. He adds that the company is very pleased to have raised almost four times its market capitalisation, and calls this raise “unprecedented”.Promise of ensifentrine in COPDZaccardelli links the oversubscribed nature of this private placement to investors seeing “value in our compelling and comprehensive data package” for lead product ensifentrine for COPD, compared to placebo. “Attracting such support provides a validation of\xa0Verona\xa0Pharma’s team, strategy and the potential opportunity for ensifentrine in respiratory disease,” he adds.\nEnsifentrine is a first-in-class drug, which combines a bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory agent into one molecule. Verona believes it has the potential to revolutionise COPD treatment, which currently “involves dual or triple therapy with long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), long-acting beta adrenoceptor agonists (LABAs) and inhaled corticosteroids”, explains Zaccardelli. Not only is this approach burdensome on the patient, the combination fails to relieve the symptoms of millions of COPD patients. New therapeutic options are urgently needed since the World Health Organization estimates the incidence of COPD is growing, and the lung disease is now the third biggest killer in the world.\nVerona is planning to use this $200m financing to fund Phase III trials of ensifentrine in COPD. These trials are expected to start later this year, and the funding will support the studies through to 2023. The trials will study ensifentrine as both a monotherapy and an add-on to either a LAMA or a LABA.\nZaccardelli concludes: “The financing is a significant milestone and brings us closer to our goal of ensuring ensifentrine is available for the millions of COPD patients who urgently need better treatments.”\nPositive results for ensifentrine in clinical trialsVerona’s Phase III programme for ensifentrine – known as ENHANCE – is being launched on the back of very promising results for ensifentrine in a Phase II programme that involved 16 clinical trials in a total of 1,300 patients.\nIn a statement, Zaccardelli noted: “We continue to be very encouraged by the Phase II results that have demonstrated ensifentrine’s effects on lung function, COPD symptoms and quality of life as well as its favourable safety profile.”\nAlthough Verona has focused on studying ensifentrine in a nebulised formulation so far – and this will be focus of the ENHANCE trials – the company recognises patients may prefer handheld inhaler formats. Therefore, it has “developed formulations of ensifentrine in dry powder inhaler and pressurised metered dose inhaler formats”, according to Zaccardelli.\nVerona has undertaken two successful Phase II trials of both dry power inhaler and pressurised metered dose inhaler formulations of ensifentrine in the last year. Following the publication of interim results in March 2020, the second half of the pressurised metered dose formulation trial has been postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nTo date, there have been no announcements from Verona about progressing these two formulations into Phase III studies.

Credit: Shutterstock.     Sign up here for GlobalData's free bi-weekly Covid-19 report on the latest information your industry needs to know.  Netherlands-based Kiadis Pharma has licensed one of its four natural killer (NK) cell therapy programmes to French pharma giant Sanofi. The programme in question is known as K-NK004 and focuses on multiple myeloma.\nThe exclusive global licensing agreement centres around modifying Kiadis’s NK cells so they do not express the glycoprotein CD38 – the modified versions are called CD38 knock out (KO) K-NK cells – and combining them with Sanofi’s newly approved anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody Sarclisa (isatuximab-irfc) to optimise multiple myeloma treatment.\nSanofi global head of immuno-oncology research and therapeutic area Dmitri Wiederschain notes: “This collaboration is part of a robust effort from Sanofi to develop treatments for patients with multiple myeloma, a difficult-to-treat blood cancer, who often need multiple lines of therapy.\n“Kiadis’s CD38KO K-NK cell therapy is highly complementary to Sanofi’s CD38 products and pipeline because it provides a way to deliver cancer-attacking natural killer cells to patients.” According to the terms of the deal, Kiadis will receive €17.5m upfront from Sanofi, and be eligible for up to €857.5m in potential milestone payments.Sanofi has also received access to Kiadis’s K-NK technology platform for two other pre-clinical programmes; further details have not been disclosed. Sanofi will be responsible for all research and development, manufacturing and commercialisation costs for the three K-NK programmes it has licensed from Kiadis.\nKiadis’s K-NK cell platformFounded in 1997, Kiadis is focused on developing personalised NK cell therapies for at-need patients. The company has developed an off-the-shelf NK-cell platform that can produce therapies for both liquid and solid tumours. Kiadis’s platform is based on NK cells from a unique universal donor, which are activated and expanded ex-vivo using proprietary PM21 particle technology.\nThese off-the-shelf NK cells “represent an attractive combination partner for other cancer therapies, such as monoclonal antibodies, that work in concert with NK cells to kill tumour cells through a process called antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)”, explains Kiadis CEO Arthur Lahr.\nKiadis’s K-NK004 programme and its proprietary CD38KO K-NK therapeutic for multiple myeloma was created and modified using this NK technology platform.\nOther products in the company’s NK pipeline are focused on haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in blood cancer, acute myeloid leukaemia and solid tumours.\nTransforming multiple myeloma treatment“Despite available treatments, multiple myeloma remains an incurable malignancy and is associated with significant patient burden,” notes Wiederschain.\nPart of the issue is that anti-CD38 antibody drugs, such as Sanofi’s Sarclisa, are the standard of care in multiple myeloma. Although they are effective, they also deplete patients’ NK cells as they also express CD38 – this is known as fratricide.\n“Kiadis’s CD38KO K-NK cells have been modified to reduce expression of CD38 and are resistant to this fratricide effect,” explains Lahr. “Adjunctive infusion of CD38KO K-NK cells can restore the natural synergism between NK cells and antibodies to kill tumour cells through CD38-targeting molecules like Sarclisa, thereby optimising efficacy.”\n“We hope that combination of Sanofi’s CD38-targeted agents with Kiadis’s NK cell therapy platform will lead to more durable clinical responses for multiple myeloma patients,” concludes Weiderschain.\nKiadis recently published an article in the journal Blood, which played out a proof of concept that expanded CD38 KO K-NK cells have the potential to boost the efficacy of an anti-CD38 antibody in multiple myeloma.\n“This publication demonstrates that CD38KO\xa0K-NK cells are resistant to killing by anti-CD38 antibodies, and demonstrates how CD38KO\xa0K-NK cells improve potency of anti-CD38 antibodies,” noted Lahr in a release. “This data showcases the scientific rationale underpinning the collaboration with Sanofi, and should enhance the understanding of the potential of this combination.”\nLooking beyond multiple myelomaSanofi is also optimistic that Kiadis’s K-NK therapies will be useful as a combination partner in other therapeutic areas. This is why Sanofi licensed two other undisclosed programmes from Kiadis at the same time as the CD38-focused K-NK004 therapy.\nWeiderschain noted: “Our partnership with Kiadis will also enable Sanofi to further our combination strategies to enhance the effectiveness of immuno-therapies more broadly.\n“For example, in addition to use with Sarclisa, Kiadis’s CD38KO K-NK cell therapy may be combined with THOR-707, a variant recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) Sanofi gained access to through the Synthorx acquisition that induces strong immunological responses in vivo.” "}, {'id': '72c21d24-ec1f-11ea-8093-fdd8c08b34d7', '__typename': 'Article', 'createdAt': '2020-09-01T06:50:40.168Z', 'updatedAt': '2020-09-01T06:50:40.168Z', 'mercuryObj': {'statusCode': 200, 'url': 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/bayer-invests-triumvira-immunologics/', 'images': ['https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2017/09/pharma-technology-logo.png', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2017/09/pharma-technology-logo-mobile.png', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/06/17BFLV0029BuflovakNewLogo_web.jpg', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/06/17BFLV0029BuflovakNewLogo_web.jpg', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2017/09/logo-249.jpg', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2017/09/logo-249.jpg', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/12/SenseAnywhere-Logo.jpg', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/12/SenseAnywhere-Logo.jpg', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/05/Create-pop-up-3.jpg', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/05/Tech-pop-up-3.jpg', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/05/life-sciences-pop-up-3.jpg'], 'title': 'Bayer invests in cancer therapies developer Triumvira Immunologics', 'excerpt': "Bayer's investment unit\xa0Leaps by Bayer and Northpond Ventures have led the $55m Series A funding round of cancer therapies developer Triumvira Immunologics.", 'source': 'www.pharmaceutical-technology.com', 'domain': 'www.pharmaceutical-technology.com'}, 'url': 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/bayer-invests-triumvira-immunologics/', 'category': 'pharma', 'subcategory': None, 'absSum': None, 'title': 'Bayer invests in cancer therapies developer Triumvira Immunologics', 'source': 'www.pharmaceutical-technology.com', 'text': "Bayer invests in Triumvira Immunologics to support development of cancer therapies.

Credit: Shutterstock.     Sign up here for GlobalData's free bi-weekly Covid-19 report on the latest information your industry needs to know.  California-based Selva Therapeutics has closed a Series A round with $3m raised. The funding for the round came from private investors, including Board of Directors member Kenneth Kelley; other participants of the round were not disclosed.\nThe proceeds of the Series A will be used to advance Selva’s lead candidate, SLV213, into clinical trials for Covid-19.\nThe company’s CEO Ted Daley explains that it is currently completing pre-clinical studies of SLV213, but this funding will allow Selva to “open an IND [investigational new drug] application, and start manufacturing of the clinical drug supply” before processing into a Phase I clinical in the third quarter of this year.\nSelva, SLV213 and Covid-19Since licensing SLV213 from University of California San Diego (UCSD), Selva has been developing the drug as an anti-parasitic for Chagas disease. This is because this parasitic disease is a growing threat to the US; although “Chagas disease is endemic to South and Central America, it is staring to expand into the US”, explains Daley. However, in March, Selva’s academic collaborator at UC San Diego, Dr James McKerrow, “shared data [on SLV213] that he and some colleagues have generated showing very high potency against SARS CoV-2 [the virus which causes Covid-19] in in vitro studies”. As a result, Daley notes, Selva shifted its focus to Covid-19 to meet this urgent priority in global public health.The reason SLV213 is effective in both Chagas disease and Covid-19 – as well as other coronaviruses, and Nipah and Ebola – is due to its novel mechanism of action. “SLV213 is a small molecule cysteine protease inhibitor”, which particularly targets one class of human proteases, called cathepsins. These “play a role in cleaving the spike protein, which enables SARS-CoV-2 virus to enter the human cell where it reproduces”, explains Daley. Therefore, by inhibiting human cathepsins, SLV213 can prevent viral entry and reproduction, which ultimately causes Covid-19.\nThis viral entry mechanism is shared by other viruses and makes SLV213 a broad-spectrum antiviral. The mechanism of acting on human, rather than viral, proteases means SLV213 also differs from many of other antiviral drugs being developed against Covid-19. These are known as direct-acting antivirals as they focus on inhibiting viral proteins and proteases – examples include remdesivir and sofosbuvir. Daley argues that a broad-spectrum antiviral that acts on a host protein could mean SLV213 is “less susceptible to viral resistance” than antivirals targeting the virus. Daley explains that “it would not be to the virus’s benefit to mutate in a way that it no longer engages the cathepsin proteins” to allow entry into the cell. Therefore, “as the SARS CoV-2 virus mutates, it’s reasonable to expect that this particular mechanism and [cell entry] pathway will remain in place”.\nIts novel mechanism also means Selva is planning to study SLV213 in moderately symptomatic or asymptomatic patients initially. This an important patient group because, Daley notes, “as this pandemic progresses and more and more people are being tested and diagnosed at earlier stages of the disease, there is a need for treatments for these patients”, primarily to slow or inhibit the progression of the infection and disease. It is also possible that SLV213 could have potential as a prophylactic treatment for Covid-19.\nThe need for combination therapies for Covid-19Daley is very clear that both broad spectrum and direct acting antivirals have a role to play in fighting Covid-19.\n“For a lot of viral diseases, there’s often not just one single treatment for all patients. Often there is more of a cocktail approach to treating viral diseases”, notes Daley. Human immunodeficiency virus is a notable example of this. “We think that is likely to be the case for SARS-CoV-2 as well”.\nSelva believes that SLV213 would be a good candidate to combine with direct acting antivirals because “ours is the only cysteine protease inhibitor being advanced into clinical development for Covid-19”. However, direct acting antivirals would enable the inhibiting of virus replication itself which is important for “viruses that do make it into the cell.”\n“There’s going to be a need for cocktail of treatments to address this disease while we’re waiting for widespread availability and administration of the vaccine. Our drug has a chance to be a really critical part of that treatment regimen”, concludes Daley.

Credit: Shutterstock.     Sign up here for GlobalData's free bi-weekly Covid-19 report on the latest information your industry needs to know.  Switzerland-headquartered oncology biotech iOnctura has closed a €20.1m Series A round led by existing investors INKEF Capital and VI Partners. The company’s founding investor M Ventures – the venture capital arm of the Merck group – also participated in the round. The fundraising was supported by two new investors: Schroder Adveq and 3B Future Health.\nLaunched in 2017, iOnctura is a spin-out from the Merck group focused on delivering “next-generation, best-in-class molecules that are at the forefront of pioneering new therapies for the treatment of cancer”, explains iOnctura CEO Catherine Pickering. The company has licensed assets from both the Merck group and Cancer Research UK that are focused on modulating the immunosuppression in the tumour microenvironment.\nThe Series A financing will be used to “enable iOnctura to accelerate development of its next generation dual immune and tumour-targeting therapies”, IOA-244 and IOA-289, notes Pickering. “The oversubscribed Series A round provides further validation and support of iOnctura’s strategy as it progresses its novel, highly selective, PI3Kδ inhibitor [IOA-244] and differentiated autotaxin [ATX] inhibitor [IOA-289] through clinical development.”\nTreating cancer and fibrosisFibrosis is “becoming a very active area of research and is extending into oncology applications”, due to awareness of the similar and complementary cellular and microenvironment processes in chronic fibrosis and cancer. Pickering notes: “Most of the initial interest is in the deeper understanding of the complex pathways involved in the fibrotic process.” This led iOnctura to look into the role of fibrotic processes in oncology to help overcome the challenges facing immunotherapy. “iOnctura is aiming to understand what is happening at a molecular level within the tumour environment and disrupt the fibrotic processes that are sustaining the tumour growth and progression,” explains Pickering. The plan is to harness this mechanism to “deliver superior clinical efficacy in monotherapy or combinations”.Pickering adds: “By building on complementary mechanisms between cancer and fibrosis, iOnctura further aims to address high unmet need in fibrotic disease.”\nTo this end, iOnctura has two lead candidates – IOA-244 and IOA-289. IOA-244 is a next-generation PI3Kδ inhibitor, which is in early clinical evaluation and is expected to enter a Phase Ib study soon. iOnctura is seeking to “clinically demonstrate for the first time that a highly selective PI3Kδ inhibition not only drives an immune-mediated response, but also a direct anti-tumoural effect in a stratified patient population across multiple solid tumour indications”, explains Pickering. IOA-289 is a novel ATX inhibitor targeting the mechanisms of fibrosis, with “superior potency compared to clinical-stage ATX inhibitors”. It is being studied as “a first-in-class therapy for solid tumour indications that over-express ATX and are burdened with cancer-associated fibrosis”, notes Pickering. IOA-289 has performed well in pre-clinical studies to date, and iOnctura is hoping to advance the drug into clinical development early next year.\nInvestors respond to the deal“M Ventures helped the founding team spin-out iOnctura from Merck in June 2017 and seed-financed the company with two programs against targets that modulate these mechanisms, with one program licensed from Cancer Research UK,” explains M Ventures vice-president Hakan Goker.\xa0 “With the seed funding, the company progressed to validate these two programs further and completed its CTA package for its lead program.”\nGoker says this Series A financing will allow iOnctura the “opportunity to speed up its clinical development to validate the biological hypotheses and potentially demonstrate effect in some tough-to-treat cancer indications”.\n“Tumour microenvironment and tumour fibrosis are key areas of unmet medical need in treating cancer,” he adds.\nGoker concludes: “We remain very excited to support the company and the experienced management team, who have impressed us with their experience and strategic thinking focused around delivering better treatments to patients.”\nVI Partners managing partner Diego Braguglia agrees, stating:“We are excited to provide continued support to iOnctura as it continues to develop its pipeline.” VI Partners is an evergreen fund created by McKinsey and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. VI Partners focuses on “stimulating and cultivating Switzerland’s start-up ecosystem”, explains Braguglia.\n“Our strategy is to identify and support a combination of talented management teams and novel treatments addressing high unmet medical needs using innovative scientific insights. In iOnctura, we found a great balance of all these components,” notes Amsterdam-based INKEF Capital managing partner Roel Bulthuis.\n“The highly experienced executive management team led by Catherine Pickering at iOnctura has a solid track record in drug development and commercialisation,” adds Bulthuis.\xa0 “iOnctura was able to align high-profile collaboration with a series of world-class scientific institutions and experts, thus consolidating a highly novel scientific understanding of the assets being developed.”\nBulthuis concludes: “These aspects, together the team’s performance regularly exceeding our expectations, are for us a true and valuable differentiator and make iOnctura stand out among the many ventures active in oncology.” "}, {'id': '7dbea4cc-ec1f-11ea-8093-fdd8c08b34d7', '__typename': 'Article', 'createdAt': '2020-09-01T06:50:58.600Z', 'updatedAt': '2020-09-01T06:50:58.600Z', 'mercuryObj': {'statusCode': 200, 'url': 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/deal-news/biontech-acquires-neon-67m/', 'images': ['https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2017/09/pharma-technology-logo.png', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2017/09/pharma-technology-logo-mobile.png', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2017/09/logo-67.jpg', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2017/09/logo-67.jpg', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/02/PS-9L.jpg', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/02/PS-78L.jpg', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/04/PTI-only-100px.jpg', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/04/PTI-only-100px.jpg', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/06/logo.png', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/06/logo.png', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/05/Create-pop-up-3.jpg', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/05/Tech-pop-up-3.jpg', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/05/life-sciences-pop-up-3.jpg'], 'title': 'BioNTech acquires T cell therapy-focused Neon for $67m', 'excerpt': 'BioNTech acquires neoantigen T cell-focused Neon in an all stock transaction valued at $2.18 per share or approximately $67m.', 'source': 'www.pharmaceutical-technology.com', 'domain': 'www.pharmaceutical-technology.com'}, 'url': 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/deal-news/biontech-acquires-neon-67m/', 'category': 'pharma', 'subcategory': None, 'absSum': None, 'title': 'BioNTech acquires T cell therapy-focused Neon for $67m', 'source': 'www.pharmaceutical-technology.com', 'text': "Neon is a biotech focused on developing neoantigen-based T cell therapies for cancers, created using its RECON and NEO-STIM technologies.

Credit: Shutterstock.     Sign up here for GlobalData's free bi-weekly Covid-19 report on the latest information your industry needs to know.  French-headquartered Valneva is one of four companies developing a vaccine against Covid-19 that has signed a supply deal with the UK Government’s Vaccines Taskforce.According to the terms of the deal, Valneva is set to supply 60 million doses of its inactivated whole Covid-19 vaccine candidate, VLA2001, from mid- 2021. Valneva is hoping to initiate clinical trials of VLA2001 by the end of this year.\nThe 60 million doses for the UK market will be produced at Valneva’s manufacturing facility in Livingstone, Scotland. This facility already produces the company’s Japanese encephalitis vaccine using the same manufacturing platform that will be employed for VLA2001.\nBuilding on this agreement with the UK Vaccines Taskforce, the UK Government has announced it has made, alongside Valneva, a joint multi-million-pound upfront investment into the Livingstone facility. This will create an additional 75 skilled jobs in the Livingstone area, and will allow Valneva to scale up its manufacturing capacity to be able to produce up to 200 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine annually. To mark this deal, the UK Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Alok Sharma visited the Livingstone site on 5 August.UK Vaccines Taskforce chair Kate Bingham commented: “In order to vaccinate our high-risk populations at the earliest opportunity, the government has agreed to proactively manufacture vaccines now, so we have millions of doses of vaccine ready if they are shown to be safe and effective.\n“This important investment in Valneva’s Scottish manufacturing plant will not only help us with this, but also ensures we are well-placed as a country to be able to cope with any pandemics or health crises in the future.” Valneva chief financial officer David Lawrence discusses why Valneva is so pleased to be part of the UK’s vaccine strategy and how this manufacturing investment supports ending the current pandemic, as well as builds future preparedness for other public health emergencies.\nAllie Nawrat: Tell me about Valneva’s Covid-19 vaccine, VLA2001 – what type of vaccine is it? David Lawrence: We have an inactivated whole virus vaccine. That compares and contrasts with other vaccine approaches, such as mRNA, which is Moderna’s, nanoparticles, which is Novavax, adenovirus, which is Oxford, and then GSK-Sanofi has another technology.\nWe are following a tried and tested approach that we already use for the Japanese encephalitis vaccine [produced] at our Livingston plant. We are leveraging that process and skilled people to apply [this approach] to a Covid-19 vaccine.\nAN: Why do you think this type of vaccine has promise in being safe and effective against SARS-CoV-2? DL: On safety, we have a very long and solid database on the safety of the approach from the Japanese encephalitis vaccine, which has been FDA approved for over a decade. Therefore, we’ve got decade’s worth of experience and data.\nNow, if you contrast that to the newer vaccines technologies that have not been [used] in humans until now. [This means] there is no data over five or ten years so [no] significant safety database has been compiled. We hope that they’re successful and we hope that they’re safe. But the profile of the new technologies, compared to proven technologies like ours, is different.\nIn terms of effectiveness, our initial research work has been encouraging. And then secondly, there is a Chinese company with a very similar approach. Their initial clinical data has been pretty positive and that gives us a sense of confidence now.\nBut we need our own clinical data. As we work towards starting our own clinical trials, which will be by the end of the year, we’ll have a number of hypotheses laid out around the vaccine based on pre-clinical data.\nAN: When is the earliest you are hoping that VLA2001 could be approved? DL: The first thing we are committing to with the UK Government is to delivery 60 million doses in the second half of next year. We are assuming for the reasons that we’re probably going to have a two-dose vaccine – so, 60 million doses would be enough for 30 million people. We will be delivering those 60 million doses over the course of the second half of next year.\nThe regulatory approval is probably going to depend on a number of factors. One will be how strong the safety and efficacy data from our initial trials is. Secondly, what is going on with other vaccines. Thirdly, the epidemiology.\nThe MHRA, in the same way as the EMA or FDA, may advance an emergency use authorisation, which would short circuit the normal process of waiting for more data. It may be easier for them to do that with proven technologies.\nAN: Why are the two deals with the UK Government and the scaling up of manufacturing in advance so important to accelerating VLA2001’s development? \xa0DL: We are absolutely thrilled; [the deals] allow us to invest faster – almost within the realms of as fast as possible – and undertake activities in parallel at risk, rather than doing them in a more traditional sequential manner.\xa0If they want to limit the time without a vaccine, supporting [development] and investing at risk is part of that decision.\n\xa0This a recognition of our expertise and capability. There is a vote of confidence from the investment and from the Secretary of state taking time out of his schedule to come and see us.\nIt takes time to order equipment and some of the components of the vaccine have a long lead time. So, the sooner you start buying, the sooner they will arrive.\nAlso, [this supports us] in buying an equivalent, adjacent facility to one we’ve already got in Livingston. We are going to produce some Covid-19 vaccines in our existing facility. [But] we will kit out the new facility and put a number of production lines in place there to accelerate the scale up that needs to take place.\nAN: How will this joint investment by the UK Government and Valneva improve future pandemic preparedness? DL: In the past 20 years, we’ve had SARS, MERS, avian flu, swine flu, Zika and Ebola. What this tells me is that it is more likely than not that something else is going to come at some stage. It may be a pathogen that no-one has heard of, or it may be an evolution of an existing pathogen.\nDuring SARS-Cov-1, [it was clear] that the infrastructure wasn’t finished and wasn’t put in place for the vaccine to be developed. Everyone recognises that there is a need this time to make sure that there’s a more robust response and to make sure that humanity is geared up better in the future.\nThe government investment alongside our own efforts will mitigate risk going forward.\nAN: How does Valneva’s deals with the UK Government support the global supply of the Covid-19 vaccine once it is approved? DL: The quid pro quo that we’ve signed with the UK Government is that, in return for investing taxpayer money, they will have priority over the first 60 million doses.\nHowever, we’re building capacity that is going to take us beyond 200 million doses per year. That’s our first commitment is to be able to supply beyond the UK subject to what happens in the 12 months.\nIf other vaccines struggle and ours continues to be more and more important, then we would look at other ways to ensure that broader capacity.\nThat is something that we haven’t looked into in detail [yet]. But we are also making our chikungunya virus vaccine in Livingston and we have an arrangement with CEPI that we should show a low and middle-income country producer how to make it. We have partnered with a company in Brazil called Instituto Butantan for a technology transfer. So that is a model that we could potentially follow.\nAlternatively, we could look to build another factory of scale, even beyond the 200 million plus courses per year. But we need to see where we are – our first priority is let’s get the factory and the process geared up. Then let’s get the clinical trial started and get those 60 million doses out the door.

Credit: Shutterstock.     Sign up here for GlobalData's free bi-weekly Covid-19 report on the latest information your industry needs to know.  Massachusetts-based Revitope Oncology has signed a research collaboration with Chinese Junshi Biosciences focused on developing next-generation antibody-based immunotherapies for cancer.\nRevitope will leverage its proprietary two-component T-cell platform and combine this with Junshi’s “best-in-class antibody components” with the aim of developing “dual targeting precision-based first-in-class cancer immunotherapies [which] can be brought into clinical trials in the near future,” explains Junshi vice-president Dr Sheng Yao.\nRevitope CEO Steve Arkinstall adds: “Leveraging Junshi’s novel antibody components along with our proprietary protein engineering platform, we believe we have the opportunity to advance our unique two-component T-cell engager therapies and deliver more efficacious and safer drugs to patients.”\nJunshi will have an exclusive license for any T Cell Engaging Antibody Circuit (TEAC) products that are developed as a result of the collaboration. In return, Revitope will receive up to $160m in development and commercialisation milestones for each TEAC molecule selected, as well as tiered royalties. Junshi has also made a $10m direct investment in Revitope for which it will received 9.99% of the company’s total shares on an as-converted basis. Revitope’s next-generation immunotherapiesRevitope’s mission is to develop “novel classes of bispecific antibody therapeutics designed to enable tumour-specific immunotherapy with improved therapeutic efficacy and safety”, explains Arkinstall.“Though there have been major advances in the field of cancer immunotherapy, one major hurdle that faces these first-generation drugs is the massive toxicity that they cause at doses that are clinically efficacious,” notes Arkinstall.\n“This is seen with today’s T-cell engager technologies that rely on targeting single antigens on the surface of cancer cells. Unfortunately, these drugs cause toxic effects on healthy cells and tissues expressing the same target antigen.” T cell engager approaches aim to redirect T cells against tumours with certain antigens so they can exert cytotoxic activity to kill cancer cells. To overcome this issue, Arkinstall explains Revitope has created a T-cell platform that designs “two-component TEACs [which] are designed to permit specific recruitment and activation of T-cells exclusively by tumour cells”.\nThis so-called next-generation immunotherapy approach relies on a pair of tumour-targeted antibodies that share a T-cell engaging domain. “This allows for true dual-antigen targeting to a unique tumour-specific address – two inputs coming together to enable one precision targeted output”, says Arkinstall.\n“Only when the two molecules come together through binding to their different tumour targets on the same tumour cell can the two halves of the CD3 binding domain recombine and create a fully functional anti-CD3 domain that can engage with T-cell,” adds Arkinstall. “Normal cells expressing only one or neither of the targeted antigens will not elicit activation of a TEAC pair thereby avoiding unwanted toxicity in healthy tissues.”\nCombining immunotherapy expertiseRevitope’s unique next-generation immunotherapy approach can be supported by “leveraging Junshi’s novel antibodies as the source of sequences to target our TEAC molecules to tumour cells together”, notes Arkinstall.\nIn addition to Junshi’s antibody expertise, the partnership will take advantage of Junshi’s proven success in advancing biologics quickly into clinical trials. “The efficiency of [Junshi’s] SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing monoclonal antibody programme (JS016) from the initial discovery to first-in-human trial in less than six months showcased Junshi’s drug development capability”, notes Yao. Junshi discovered the neutralising antibodies in Febuary and dosed the first patient in a Phase I trial in collaboration with Eli Lilly in June.\nBy combining both companies’ knowhow, Arkinstall concludes: “We believe we have the opportunity to\xa0rapidly\xa0advance our unique two-component T-cell engager therapies to the clinic and deliver more efficacious and safer drugs to patients.” "}, {'id': '85af3f02-ec1f-11ea-8093-fdd8c08b34d7', '__typename': 'Article', 'createdAt': '2020-09-01T06:51:11.921Z', 'updatedAt': '2020-09-01T06:51:11.921Z', 'mercuryObj': {'statusCode': 200, 'url': 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/abbvie-harvard-uni-alliance/', 'images': ['https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2017/09/pharma-technology-logo.png', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2017/09/pharma-technology-logo-mobile.png', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/05/Solvias-AG-CP-Pharma-2009_news_large.jpg', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/05/Solvias-AG-CP-Pharma-2009_news_large.jpg', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/04/METO-LOGO.jpg', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/04/METO-LOGO.jpg', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/04/Product-5-Picture.jpg', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/04/Product-4-Picture-2.png', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/07/medelpharm_logoclaim_72dpi.png', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/07/medelpharm_logoclaim_72dpi.png', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/nano.jpg', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/07/PS-4L.jpg', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/05/Create-pop-up-3.jpg', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/05/Tech-pop-up-3.jpg', 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/05/life-sciences-pop-up-3.jpg'], 'title': 'AbbVie teams up with Harvard University for viral disease therapies', 'excerpt': 'AbbVie has entered into a research collaboration with Harvard University to evaluate and develop new therapies for emergent viral infections.', 'source': 'www.pharmaceutical-technology.com', 'domain': 'www.pharmaceutical-technology.com'}, 'url': 'https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/abbvie-harvard-uni-alliance/', 'category': 'pharma', 'subcategory': None, 'absSum': None, 'title': 'AbbVie teams up with Harvard University for viral disease therapies', 'source': 'www.pharmaceutical-technology.com', 'text': "AbbVie will offer $30m over three years, along with access to its scientists, expertise and facilities.

Credit: Shutterstock.     Sign up here for GlobalData's free bi-weekly Covid-19 report on the latest information your industry needs to know.  Switzerland-based Numab Therapeutics has signed a research and licensing agreement with German pharma giant Boehringer Ingelheim to develop novel drugs for the latter’s three key disease focus areas.\nThe collaboration will leverage Numab’s multi-specific antibody technology platform to discover novel drug candidates for the three areas: difficult-to-treat lung and gastrointestinal (GI) cancers and geographic atrophy (GA), a retinal disease associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD).\nNumab CEO David Urech says: “Boehringer Ingelheim brings profound knowledge on the biology of cancer as well as retinal disorders into the collaboration. In-depth understanding of the biology of diseases is the basis for the conception of novel mechanisms of action.\n“With our multi-specific platform, we are confident that we can actualise Boehringer Ingelheim’s innovative concepts and come up with truly differentiated therapeutics. Boehringer Ingelheim will have an exclusive worldwide license to further develop and commercialise the resulting therapies. In return, Numab will receive upfront and milestone payments, and tiered royalties on net sales of the products.Promise of multi-specific antibody therapies“Targeting complex mechanisms is often very challenging, if not impossible, by using [a] combination of single molecules,” says Boehringer Ingelheim’s associate director of biotherapeutics technologies, business development and licensing Dr Marcio Lasaro. “Multi-specific antibodies can enable these therapeutic approaches and keep the manufacturing process sustainable.”\nNumab has created a “highly differentiated multi-specific antibody platform designed to overcome the various limitations of conventional antibody technologies”, explains Urech. “With multi-specific formats we can create entirely novel mechanisms of action that would not be possible with simple combination of different agents.” It is a plug-and-play platform based on modular antibody Fv fragment engineering technology, which Urech says provides “unprecedented stability and the ability to generate highly stable multi-specific antibody formats”. Urech notes it allows for “a highly rational and reproducible process to rapidly yield promising clinical candidates with new mechanisms of action, superior efficacy and a favourable safety profile.”\nBoehringer Ingelheim has been very impressed with Numab’s platform. “Boehringer Ingelheim has made significant investments in multi-specific antibodies through previous collaborations and by building on its internal capabilities,” says Lasaro. But “we have found that when it comes to multi-specific formats, it’s not one-size-fits-all. This collaboration brings Numab’s distinctive formats to address particular needs of the therapeutic concepts we are pursuing.”\nUses in GA and difficult-to-treat cancersThese next-generation multi-specific antibody drugs have promise in a range of different conditions – Numab is already using this platform to develop its therapeutics with various partners in the areas of oncology and inflammatory conditions.\nHowever, Boehringer Ingelheim and Numab will be collaborating to deliver “transformative antibody-based therapeutics to patients” in the diseases areas of oncology, particularly challenging lung and GI cancers, and GA, notes Lasaro.\nUrech explains that Numab’s multi-specific approach is particularly promising for retinal conditions, such as GA, because it has advantages for drug administration “particularly to small body compartments, such as the eye, where limited injection volumes make it difficult to combine parenteral therapeutics”.\nGA represents a significant unmet need because although it is a “leading cause of blindness worldwide” and affects seven million people globally, patients currently have no treatment options, according to Lasaro. “For retinal diseases, the multi-specific concept allows targeting of an elegant mechanism to treat a progressive and irreversible retinal disease occurring in patients with AMD.”\nIn terms of oncology, Lasaro explains the partners will be working on developing a “novel T-cell engager” that will support “Boehringer Ingelheim’s strategy to target so-called ‘cold’ tumours that are not visible to the immune system by combining cancer immunology and cancer cell directed approaches”. Urech adds that this will involve leveraging Numab’s proprietary T-cell engager platform. "}]

Shared by the Defense Ministry and Elbit Systems, it includes labs for the production of lenses and mirrors, as well as a vacuum chamber that simulates conditions in space, which is used to test the satellite camera before it is launched for its mission.The pictures released on Monday were taken over Syria and show the Tadmor world heritage site, ancient ruins and the renowned Roman theater.The ministry plans to transfer the satellite to the IDF’s 9900 Intelligence Unit in the near future upon the completion of its “in-orbit testing” process. Like other reconnaissance satellites launched by Israel, Ofek 16 will be used to monitor threats facing the Jewish state. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });Israel has admitted to hundreds of airstrikes against Iranian targets and infrastructure to prevent the transfer of weapons, from ammunition to surface-to-air missile kits, to Hezbollah in Lebanon for the entrenchment of its forces on the Golan.Israel has been accused of airstrikes close to Tadmor, specifically the T-4 Airbase located between Homs and Palmyra, which Iran has been using to fly in military cargo.In April, nine fighters belonging to the Syrian Arab Army and Iranian militias were killed in an airstrike on the city of Palmyra, which was blamed on Israel.

Jordan was also invited, but King Abdullah declined unless Palestinian Authority Mahmoud Abbas was included; Israel agreed to invite Abbas. A PA official, however, told JNS that they will not attend as part of their continued boycott of Washington.Schneier said Saudi Arabia would have to be the country to lead the way for other states along the Persian Gulf when it comes to the Trump peace plan.“There’s a regional balance of power,” he explained. “In order to affect a real change, the Saudis would need to meet with the Israeli prime minister.” cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });In addition, “just as the Saudis led a peace initiative in 2002, it would only be natural for them to be at the forefront of [the new US] peace initiative and mediate between the Israelis and Palestinians,” Schneier said.The Saudis are “pleased that the process has been resurrected by the Americans,” the rabbi added.They also expressed concerns that the plan must meet “minimal standards” for a Palestinian state and the status of Jerusalem.Riyadh “offered a plan almost 20 years ago, and I remind them that it took the Israelites 40 years to get to the Promised Land. It’s not going to happen overnight. I think people appreciate it’s a process,” Schneier stated.As the leader of the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding, Schneier visits Gulf states several times a year for interreligious dialogue, but is also a major proponent of establishing relations between Israel and those states. Schneier is an official adviser to the king of Bahrain and works with the emir of Qatar, as well as the leadership in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

He became acting leader after Badie’s arrest in August 2013.An interior ministry statement said Ezzat had been arrested from an apartment used as a hide-out in Cairo’s Fifth Settlement district, and was accused of joining and leading a terrorist group and receiving illicit funds. Egyptian authorities accuse the Brotherhood of promoting militancy and subversion, accusations it strongly denies.The interior ministry said encrypted communications equipment had been seized during the arrest, and said Ezzat was suspected of overseeing several assassinations or attempted assassinations as well as a bombing since 2013.Ezzat had previously been sentenced to death and to life in prison in absentia.

It was renamed the Kariye Camii after its conversion into a mosque.A church was first built at the site in the 4th century, but most of the existing building dates to an 11th century church that was partly rebuilt 200 years later following an earthquake. “The management of the Kariye Mosque be transferred to the Religious Affairs Directorate, and opened to worship," Erdogan said, according to Middle East watchdog Al-Monitor.The move follows another that sparked international criticism and concern, after Erdoğan declared Hagia Sophia open to Muslim worship earlier this month following a similar court ruling. The ancient structure was first built as a Byzantine church around 537 AD. It was then converted to a mosque in 1453. The Ottomans built minarets alongside the vast domed structure, while inside they added panels bearing the Arabic names of God, the Prophet Mohammad and Muslim caliphs.In an attempt to recognize the structure’s dual heritage and to make a statement about Turkey’s secular nature, former Turkish president Mustafa Kemal Ataturk turned Hagia Sophia into a museum in 1934. The golden mosaics and Christian icons, obscured by the Ottomans, were uncovered again when Hagia Sophia became a museum.The site was inscribed onto UNESCO’s World Heritage List in 1985 under Historic Areas of Istanbul, along with other points of significance in the city. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: \'36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b\' }).render(\'4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6\'); });A few weeks back, Erdogan led the first prayers at Hagia Sophia in nine decades, sealing his ambition to restore Muslim worship at an ancient site long revered in both Christianity and Islam - an ambition he intends to do extend once again with the Church of the Holy Savior. At Hagia Sophia, curtains have been drawn in front of an image facing worshipers of Mary and the infant Jesus. Turkish newspaper Daily Sabah noted that religious authorities intend to cover up the Byzantine-era art during worship within the walls of the Church of the Holy Savior - it is not clear when said worship will begin to take place within the structure.

His conviction on the charge of “colluding against national security” was affirmed by the Tehran Appeals Court on July 27, IranWire news website reported.“Subjecting an elderly journalist to prolonged detention in the midst of a pandemic on unsubstantiated charges is inhumane and yet another example of Iran’s complete disregard for the work and safety of the press,” CPJ Middle East and North Africa program coordinator Sherif Mansour said. “We call on the Iranian authorities to release Kayvan Samimi immediately,” he added.Iranian authorities arrested Samimi on May 1, 2019, which was International Labor Day, for reporting on a demonstration in front of Tehran’s parliament building.Iran’s regime frequently uses bogus charges to imprison journalists and crack down on attempts of independent reporting.CPJ wrote: “In April 2020, Tehran Judge Iman Afshari convicted Samimi of ‘colluding against national security’ and ‘spreading propaganda against the system’ over his coverage of the protests, and sentenced him to six years in prison, at a hearing without the journalist or his lawyer present, according to that report.”Samimi contested the April verdict and requested a new trial. In May, according to CPJ, he “was again convicted of collusion, but the propaganda charge was dropped and his sentence was reduced to three years in prison.” cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); }); "}, {'id': '1d83140d-ec25-11ea-8093-fdd8c08b34d7', '__typename': 'Article', 'createdAt': '2020-09-01T07:31:15.163Z', 'updatedAt': '2020-09-01T07:31:15.163Z', 'mercuryObj': {'title': 'Is Turkey moving into northern Lebanon?', 'author': None, 'date_published': None, 'dek': None, 'lead_image_url': 'https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/t_JD_ArticleMainImageFaceDetect/462763', 'next_page_url': None, 'url': 'https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/is-turkey-moving-into-northern-lebanon-640226', 'domain': 'www.jpost.com', 'excerpt': 'BEHIND THE LINES: First signs emerge that Sunni Islamist Ankara is seeking to fill the vacuum', 'word_count': 1240, 'direction': 'ltr', 'total_pages': 1, 'rendered_pages': 1, 'source': 'www.jpost.com'}, 'url': 'https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/is-turkey-moving-into-northern-lebanon-640226', 'category': 'armiger', 'subcategory': None, 'absSum': None, 'title': 'Is Turkey moving into northern Lebanon?', 'source': 'www.jpost.com', 'text': " According to a report on the pro-Saudi Al Arabiya website published on August 19, officials in Lebanon are concerned at increased indications of Turkish efforts to build strength and influence in the country. The report quoted two sources in Lebanese intelligence, who mentioned recent Turkish efforts to bring weapons into northern Lebanon. “We are pretty worried about what’s going on. The Turks are sending an incredible amount of weapons into the north,” the website quoted its source as saying. These reports await confirmation, and Al Arabiya is of course a media source linked to Saudi Arabia – a state rival of Turkey’s. But the evidence for a broader Turkish effort to build influence and allies in Lebanon in recent months is considerable, and solid. As are the indications of a Turkish-controlled infrastructure emerging in Sunni northern Lebanon. Both fit with the broader pattern both of Turkish behavior and of broader regional realities. In terms of the former, Turkey is actively involved using both its own forces and proxies in the two fragmented Arab countries to Lebanon’s east – Syria and Iraq. The deployments in both countries already have the look of the long term about them, with clearly defined areas of control. Turkey is also active in Libya, where its backing of Fayez Sarraj’s government almost certainly prevented the fall of Tripoli to the forces of Gen. Khalifa Haftar earlier this year. To these areas add Turkey’s aggressive naval stance in the Eastern Mediterranean, and its active backing of Hamas in Gaza and the West Bank and of Islamist organizations in Jerusalem. All these add up to a strategy in which Ankara is seeking to emerge as the main strategic beneficiary of the chaos and fragmentation that has gripped much of the region over the last decade. Regarding broader regional realities, Iraq, Syria, Libya – and Lebanon – today are geographical spaces rather than states in the sense traditionally understood. Within these spaces, rival regional and global powers are competing for ascendancy. Turkey is a central player in the first three countries named. It would be surprising if it were not active in the fourth. Other regional players are paying close attention to Turkey’s belligerent stance. The Times this week reported Mossad head Yossi Cohen as telling Arab intelligence chiefs that “Iranian power is fragile... but the real threat is from Turkey.”In the countries mentioned above, Turkey seeks to leverage both its Sunni Islamist credentials to appeal to Sunni Arab populations, and where relevant its Turkic ethnicity to appeal to Turkic remnant populations in the Levant. Available evidence suggests that in Lebanon, a similar pattern is being followed. Turkey has been working slowly and assiduously, via NGOs and government relief organizations such as the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency – TIKA – (also active in Jerusalem), to establish its foothold in the country.  cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });A recent article by Mohanad Hage Ali at the Carnegie Middle East Center noted the arrest on July 4 of two Turkish and two Syrian citizens on a flight to Lebanon from Turkey. The four attempted to smuggle $4 million into the country. Lebanese Interior Minister Mohammed Fahmi claimed that the money was intended to finance street-level protests against the Lebanese government.Turkey’s activities appear to be taking place at the grassroots level, and to be centered around the northern city of Tripoli, an urban center for the Lebanese Sunni population. It is a conservative, religious place and a stronghold of Sunni political Islam. As such, the area is a natural focus for Turkey. The Akkar Governorate, home to Lebanon’s tiny Turkmen minority, is also an area of interest. \xa0A July 12 article by Nahla Nasir al-Din on the Asas website of former Lebanese interior minister Nohad Machnouk, accused Turkey of seeking to “occupy Tripoli,” and included details of alleged Turkish activities in these areas. The article contains a welter of detail on alleged Turkish activities in northern Lebanon. It named Gen. Ashraf Rifi, former head of the Internal Security Forces and former justice minister, as a collaborator with Turkish intelligence in Ankara’s efforts in this area. Nasir al-Din also names Bahaa Hariri, eldest son of murdered prime minister Rafik Hariri, as engaged in the Turkish intelligence’s project to create a network of grassroots religious and political organizations among Lebanese Sunnis in Tripoli. The purpose of the network would be for it to act as a tool for the advancement of Turkish influence in Lebanon, available to be mobilized and brought to the streets at the appropriate time. Nasir al-Din further claimed that direct links are maintained in Beirut between representatives of the ruling Turkish party, the Justice and Development Party (AKP), and the local Lebanese Muslim Brotherhood party, Jamaa Islamiya. A July 13 article by Firas al-Shoufi in the pro-Hezbollah Al Akhbar newspaper summed up the situation in the following terms: “Turkish activity in Lebanon takes many forms, all leading in one direction, which is to strengthen Turkish influence among the Sunni Muslims in Lebanon, specifically in the north, and to confront the already eroding Saudi-Emirati influence in the war of leadership of the ‘Sunni world’ raging between Saudi Arabia and its allies on the one hand, and Turkey and its allies on the other hand.” Shoufi named specific social welfare projects undertaken by TIKA in the Tripoli and Akkar areas, such as “opening roads, digging wells for drinking and irrigation water and providing food aid.” He further notes that “General-Director of the Sûreté Générale [Lebanon’s main internal security organization] Maj.- Gen. Abbas Ibrahim made a series of observations about the Turkish performance during a meeting of the Supreme Council of Defense, on the basis of the need for the Lebanese state to monitor what foreign parties do inside Lebanon. Ibrahim also contacted the Turkish ambassador in Beirut, Hakan Cakil, and asked him about Turkey’s relationship with groups carrying flags and engaging in social activism in the north, who carry out actions that threaten security and block roads.’Shoufi’s identification of the Turks moving into a vacuum left by the relative absence of the Saudis and Emiratis is of particular note. All the evidence cited in the various Arabic outlets cited above should be treated with some caution. It is not yet possible to draw a definitive picture of the details of Turkish activity in northern Lebanon. But the very fact that the issue appears able to raise the joint concerns of channels affiliated with or supportive of Saudi Arabia (Al Arabiya) and Iran/Hezbollah (Al Akhbar) indicates that something does appear to be going on. The fragile Lebanese sectarian balance has been shattered over the last decade by the entry of around one million overwhelmingly Sunni Syrian refugees. Their presence has reversed the previous sense of an inexorable rise of the Shia to ascendancy in Lebanon. Until now, however, no force has proven able to harness the potential Sunni power in Lebanon to its cause. The Saudi-supported March 14 Movement was vanquished on the streets of West Beirut by Hezbollah and Amal in May-June 2008. The Gulf Arabs appeared to have more or less conceded the country to the Iranians, content to allow Iran and its local franchise to deal with a collapsing economy and infrastructure. As of now, however, the first signs are emerging that Sunni Islamist Turkey is seeking to fill the vacuum, and to recruit the Lebanese Sunni street to its banner. Something is happening in northern Lebanon.

Former US ambassador James Jeffrey, who is now the US envoy for Syria and the anti-ISIS campaign, went to Turkey and said the US had “proved our value in many fields outside of Syria.” The comments were reported on Turkey’s TRT and by pro-government media in Turkey. Turkey is the largest jailer of journalists in the world and almost all of its media is now on the side of the ruling party. Jeffrey’s comments appeared to be an attempt to appease Turkey, a day after the US had slammed the regime for hosting Hamas terrorists. The comments by Jeffrey are the latest in his endless praise of Turkey and never holding the country to account. The US State Department critiqued Ankara for hosting Hamas members. In response, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan claimed the US had sided with terrorist organizations in Syria. In response, Jeffrey made his comment about how the US was trying to prove its value to Turkey. Usually, smaller countries like Turkey are expected to prove their values as allies to the US, but in the Ankara-Washington relationship, it is the other way around. Although Turkey buys Russia’s S-400 system and works with Iran and US adversaries, some American officials still seek to placate Turkey, even up to the point of sabotaging other US policies in the Middle East. \xa0In recent years, Ankara has imprisoned an American pastor and consular official, threatened US soldiers and continually bashed the US and its allies such as Israel. However, some in the Trump administration are very close to Ankara and often appear to enable Turkey’s increasingly aggressive behavior against Greece, its invasions of Syria, bombing of Iraq and bashing of Israel. For instance, according to pro-government Anadolu media in Turkey, Erdogan called Trump this week after hosting Hamas. Turkey spoke about its demands in the Eastern Mediterranean, where it has harassed Greece and also sought to stop an Israeli-Greek pipeline. The USS Winston S. Churchill destroyer participated in a naval exercise in the Mediterranean with Turkey’s Barbados and Burgazada frigates on August 26. \xa0WHILE THE US navy was conducting the passing exercise of Passex with Turkish counterparts, Washington was also working with Ankara to sideline its own partners in Syria. Since 2015, the US Central Command has worked with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to fight ISIS. Some in the US State Department, however, have always preferred other Syrian rebel groups and sought to work through Ankara to support more extreme Islamist groups that Turkey favors.  cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });Turkey has sought to take over Kurdish areas in northern Syria and displace Kurds by settling mostly Arab Syrian refugees and armed militias in areas previously under Kurdish control. Turkish-backed militias in Syria are accused of kidnapping women from ethnic minorities and targeting women activists for assassination. As part of this effort to back extremists, Ankara calls the SDF, which the US arms and trains, a “terrorist” group. There is no evidence of any terrorism from Syria directed against Turkey, except by ISIS. Nevertheless, Turkey views the SDF as linked to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). \xa0US envoy Jeffrey praised the Syrian Constitutional Committee on August 26, mentioning the third round of meetings in Geneva where America has backed Syrian opposition groups in dialogue to end the conflict in Syria. However, the State Department’s envoys who are pro-Turkey have sidelined US partners in Syria and made sure they are unable to play any role in the Syrian peace process.Jeffrey said the meetings in Geneva were a “good start, much helped by Turkey’s encouragement of all members of the Constitutional Committee, particularly the opposition.” But Washington has worked with Ankara to exclude any group linked to eastern Syria, the same area where the US has the most influence. The Syrian Rojava Information Center news agency noted on August 22 that “all representatives of North and East Syria, a region covering one third of the country and which partnered with the international community to defeat ISIS, are once again excluded from the next round of official negotiations on Syria.” The result in Syria has been that the US State Department made sure that US Central Command’s partners in the autonomous administration of eastern Syria could play no political role. In short, some in the State Department work against the Pentagon. US adversaries find this comical, knowing they can exploit differences in US policy to weaken the US role in Syria. That is how Turkey, Russia, Iran, China and other countries have eroded the US role. The excuse that US diplomats use for excluding American partners in Syria is that they are not a “state,” and the US only works with states. But Jeffrey works with other Syrian opposition groups – those sponsored by Turkey. Ironically, the group that the US as a nation has sponsored is the SDF, which gets almost no support from US diplomats who prefer to work with Turkish-backed groups than their own US-backed SDF. While Turkey not only openly hosts Hamas but also Syrian extremist rebel groups, the US diplomats often won’t even meet openly with US partners in eastern Syria.ON THE SURFACE this makes no sense. But it does make sense if those diplomats' end goal has been to force the SDF and its civilian components to work with the Syrian regime to take part in Geneva discussions. Those close to Jeffrey’s team have argued on social media that the US could leave eastern Syria, as Washington intended to do in the fall of 2018. America eventually did leave the border area with Turkey in October 2019 – and the result was a Turkish invasion. The SDF, faced with ethnic cleansing by Ankara’s campaign the way Turkey had forced 160,000 Kurds and minorities out of Afrin in 2018, sought out Damascus and Moscow. Russia signed a deal with Turkey to end its offensive, and Russian patrols were soon in eastern Syria. On August 25, one of the Russian patrols clashed with a US patrol, injuring US Central Command soldiers. The Russians would not have been there had the US not withdrawn. In addition Turkish-backed rebel groups regularly turn off water to eastern Syria, causing hundreds of thousands to be without water as Covid-19 threats continue. The entire Turkish policy in Syria thus empowers extremists and Russia, isolating US-backed partners.\xa0 The US State Department's views, at odds with the Pentagon’s mission of defeating ISIS and stabilizing eastern Syria, have been known for years, ever since pro-Ankara voices were advanced to take control of Syria policy. In 2018, Jeffrey said that the future of the Syrian Kurds would be with Damascus. The US doesn’t work with “sub-state entities,” the US envoy said. The State Department characterized the work with the SDF as “tactical, transactional and temporary.” Yet the same officials were warmer in working with Turkish-backed opposition groups – more warm than with their own US partners in eastern Syria. \xa0The result of the US sidelining the SDF from any political role in Geneva was that it created a strange self-fulfilling prophecy whereby the SDF was forced to work with the Syrian regime and Russia in areas the US had abandoned – and then US officials would point to this work with Damascus and Moscow as evidence of why it should only work with Turkish-backed groups. But the regime in Damascus has rejected an agreement with the SDF and would only incorporate them on its terms. A US initiative to get the SDF to work with Kurdish groups in Iraq was brokered in June, but that idea seems like a dead end because the pro-Turkish diplomats still wouldn’t work with the SDF, even if it shifted to be closer to the Kurdistan Regional Government. The problem for the KRG is that Turkey already occupied parts of northern Iraq and is fighting against the PKK there. Ankara would never allow the KRG to work with the SDF. \xa0THE US APPEARS to be trying to get Turkey to play a larger role in northern Iraq as well, which would further isolate US partners in eastern Syria. In a briefing with US Deputy Assistant Secretary for Iraq Affairs David Copley and Joey Hood, the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, the US officials said they wanted Turkey and Iraq to work closely together to address concerns about the PKK’s presence. Turkey has been bombing northern Iraq, killing civilians and Iraqi security forces, but Washington said that Ankara has “legitimate security concerns.” Turkey occupies part of northern Iraq, and the US calls this “good for stability.” Hood proposed that Turkey could play a role in the Yazidi area of Sinjar. This is an area where ISIS committed genocide in 2014. Turkey has a track record of discriminating against members of the Yazidi minority. In Afrin, Turkish-backed militants have ethnically cleansed Yazidis and Turkey has been bombing Sinjar, making it difficult for civilians to return to the area. Hood suggested that Turkey, Iraq’s government in Baghdad and the Kurdistan Regional Government could “clear out militias, including the PKK” from Sinjar. It was unclear why the US official was suggesting Turkey could play a role in Sinjar, since the US doesn’t suggest that Iraq play a role in eastern Turkey, even though Turkey appears to get State Department support for invading Iraq, Syria and other countries. \xa0The US State Department that now proposes that the Kurdistan Regional Government play a role in Sinjar is the same one that in October 2017, when Iraq sent Iranian-backed militias to invade Sinjar, did not work with the Kurdish region to oppose the invasion but instead was busy condemning the Kurds for an independence referendum. The US actually worked with Baghdad in 2017 during the attacks on Kurds that year as Kirkuk and Sinjar were taken over by pro-Iranian groups, such as Kataib Hezbollah. Oddly the US empowered the very militias it now suggests Turkey play a role in removing in northern Iraq. This may be simply because in the end, some in the US government have quietly favored Turkey to take over northern Iraq as it has done with Tel Abyad and Afrin. Since Yazidis have had to flee Turkey’s invasions of those two regions, it is odd that US officials would suggest Ankara play a role in Sinjar and that Yazidis might return home if “militias” are removed. \xa0THE SINJAR plan mentioned in the August 25 meeting is part of the overall policy of advancing Turkey’s interests throughout Syria and Iraq. In Syria, the US diplomats sideline America's military partners by making sure they cannot play a role in Geneva and encouraging them to work with Damascus, while also condemning them for doing so. In northern Iraq, the US stood silent as Baghdad and its Iranian-backed militias took over Sinjar from the Kurdistan region in 2017, only to now turn around and suggest that the Kurdistan region and Turkey play a role in Sinjar. The end result of a greater Turkish role in Sinjar would be to cut off the Kurdistan region of Iraq from eastern Syria and further isolate the SDF, which is Ankara’s goal.While the US military continues to try to salvage eastern Syria, it appears that American diplomats actively work toward opposing purposes. A US oil company has recently sought a deal in eastern Syria, but Trump’s calls with Erdogan, Jeffrey’s praise of the Geneva process that sidelines the SDF and other developments do not bode well. The president said the US is leaving Iraq “fairly rapidly” and making decisions on Syria “fairly soon,” in discussions with Iraq’s prime minister on August 20. The US State Department policy of outsourcing US policy in northern Iraq and Syria to Turkey may dovetail with the White House desire to leave entirely. The Trump administration has long wanted others to take up the slack for the US. The SDF, sidelined and isolated, has nevertheless continued to tamp down on ISIS and hold thousands of ISIS detainees. In recent months, Turkish intelligence has sought to smuggle some families from among the detainees in Al-Hol camp to Turkey. At the same time the SDF faced challenges from tribes near the Euphrates River who chafe under SDF control. This is also the end-result of a US policy that encouraged the SDF to take Arab areas along the Euphrates as part of the anti-ISIS campaign. While the Kurdish areas of Syria were mostly abandoned by the US in October 2019, the SDF, initially a mostly Kurdish force, came to control mostly Arab areas. This further isolates the SDF from long-term prospects in Syria because the very areas where it was most popular are now under armored patrols by the Syrian regime and Russia. Those are the very patrols that clashed with an American one this week, injuring US soldiers. \xa0The whole situation in eastern Syria continues to limp along as it has for the last two and half years, lacking clarity. Overall, the US diplomats who have been intensely pro-Ankara – to the extent that Ankara’s interests seem to come before the US role in Syria – have left confusion, instability and a lack of faith in Washington’s commitment.\xa0  "}, {'id': '1fe4a0c6-ec25-11ea-8093-fdd8c08b34d7', '__typename': 'Article', 'createdAt': '2020-09-01T07:31:18.124Z', 'updatedAt': '2020-09-01T07:31:18.124Z', 'mercuryObj': {'title': 'The search for a culprit after Beirut blast', 'author': None, 'date_published': None, 'dek': None, 'lead_image_url': 'https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/t_JD_ArticleMainImageFaceDetect/462692', 'next_page_url': None, 'url': 'https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/the-search-for-a-culprit-after-beirut-blast-640124', 'domain': 'www.jpost.com', 'excerpt': 'Who bears responsibility for the deadly port explosions, and what are the global implications?', 'word_count': 2464, 'direction': 'ltr', 'total_pages': 1, 'rendered_pages': 1, 'source': 'www.jpost.com'}, 'url': 'https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/the-search-for-a-culprit-after-beirut-blast-640124', 'category': 'armiger', 'subcategory': None, 'absSum': None, 'title': 'The search for a culprit after Beirut blast', 'source': 'www.jpost.com', 'text': " Beirut is recovering. People are snapping selfies near the ruined port where explosions at a warehouse killed more than 150 people and wounded thousands in early August. Now Lebanon wants more support from the international community.Looming in the background is Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed terrorist group, which has distanced itself from the ammonium nitrate stored in a warehouse that caused the blasts. While the Lebanese initially protested in the wake of the mass killing, they have now become quieter, lest the country tip into greater instability and chaos. At stake are interests from Moscow to Riyadh and Istanbul to Damascus.Slowly, port operations have moved to Tripoli in northern Lebanon, a city known to be more of a “Sunni stronghold” than southern Lebanon’s Shi’ite villages and Beirut’s Maronites, or the Druze villages that dot areas just south of the capital. It is unknown what the long-term consequences of the economic changes will be or how Lebanon will be bailed out. The country needs some $90 billion, and international organizations are concerned about Lebanon becoming a sinkhole for more investment. After all, Lebanon should be a profitable state because its diaspora is fabulously wealthy and many of its communities seem to enjoy largesse from different foreign powers. In the most clichéd simplicity: The Saudis and Turkey seek to buy up the Sunnis, Iran backs the Shi’ites, Damascus has its friends, and France supports the Christians.The real question plaguing anyone who wants to look beneath the cliché is to ask what happened on August 4, when explosions rocked Beirut, tearing through the port and buildings and causing damage for miles. But asking what happened also seems to conjure up more clichés: Let those sleeping dogs lie. Don’t poke the bear. This is because what is known about the blast does not add up. A warehouse with ammonium nitrate exploded. This has happened in the past. In 1917 a ship blew up in Halifax, Nova Scotia, killing 1,950 people. In 1921, an explosion of ammonium sulphate in Oppau, Germany, claimed 565. Ammonium nitrate blew up in Toulouse, France, in 2001, killing 31 people. The explosions in Germany and Canada yielded more tonnage than the one in Beirut. RIDING BY the ruins of a traditional Lebanese house, August 14. (Alkis Konstantinidis/Reuters) cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });However, the Beirut blast is still relatively unique. In short: Ammonium nitrate doesn’t blow up and destroy cities every day. In fact, it almost never does.Since the massive explosion, many articles have been written, yet only a few have sought to establish what might have happened that led to the explosions. There are some reasons for this. Some do not want to know. They prefer the easy answer of “a warehouse where ammonium nitrate was stored for seven years exploded due to a mistake.” Don’t mention Hezbollah. Don’t mention that the terror movement has sought ammonium nitrate all over the world and previously stored it in Europe. Don’t mention that Hezbollah has even threatened to target similar chemical storage facilities in Israel to cause exactly the kind of explosions that tore through Beirut.The usual process of cover-ups and irresponsibility in Beirut provide the plausible deniability needed by the government of Michel Aoun, which is backed by Hezbollah. Aoun came to power after Hezbollah hijacked the presidency, which is reserved for a Christian, and got its Christian ally into power. Back in 2005 Hezbollah had assassinated the former Sunni prime minister of Lebanon, Rafic Hariri. The UN tribunal investigating the murder for many years was due to rule on a verdict the same week as the Beirut explosion. Instead, they postponed the decision for two weeks and then only fingered one Hezbollah operative, clearing the names of another two. A fourth Hezbollah member was already dead but was suspected of being the mastermind. Hezbollah didn’t act alone to kill Hariri; it would have had to obtain approval from Tehran and probably Damascus as well. The code leading to Hezbollah was cracked by following its phone network, the same one that it rioted to keep in 2008, coming to control parts of Beirut. The man who uncovered the network was Major Wissam Eid of the Lebanese Internal Security Forces Information Branch. He was murdered. All this is well-known.Iran and its allies have a habit of doing things that are flagrant violations of international law right in front of everyone. Iran attacked Saudi Arabia with drones and cruise missiles in September 2019. It mined six ships in the Gulf of Oman in May and June 2019. It downed a civilian jet liner in January 2020, denied it, then claimed it was an “accident.” It’s not as if Tehran hides all this. Hezbollah openly stockpiles 150,000 rockets in Lebanon, illegally. No other country has a Hezbollah around its neck, blackmailing its parliament and maintaining an extralegal terrorist army. But Lebanon, hollowed out and forced to sleepwalk through history with Hezbollah at the controls, does not want to ask the tough questions, not about Hariri or about Beirut in 2020.A LOOK at the footprints that led to the Beirut blast reveals a series of articles explaining why the explosion might have been accidental but also why suspicions remain. Reuters, which has expertise in investigative reporting on shipping, examined the path the ship took that brought the ammonium nitrate that caused the explosion. On August 11, we learned of this murky story. It begins with the Moldovan-flagged MV Rhosus, a heap of a ship that limped into Beirut in 2013. Inspectors in Spain had already flagged the ship for lack of seaworthiness. Reuters went to 10 countries to track down what happened. The ship brought 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate to the Port of Beirut. “Those linked to the shipment” all denied knowledge of the cargo’s original owner, though it came from a Georgian fertilizer maker. The ship was supposedly bound for Mozambique.The rusty vessel got the cargo in September 2013. According to Reuters, the ship’s captain was told by a Russian businessman, Igor Grechushkin, to make an “unscheduled stop in Beirut to take on extra cargo.” The Rhosus sailed into Beirut in November, the cold season. Detained in Beirut because of its poor condition, the vessel sat there for years and its cargo was moved to the shore. “Creditors accused the ship’s legal owner, listed as a Panama-based firm, of abandoning the vessel.” The miserable heap sank in 2018. That was one problem gone.The cargo was worth only $700,000, Reuters says, and the ship was uninsured. Its Russian captain, Boris Prokoshev, lives in Sochi today. In Mozambique, Reuters found the firm Fabrica de Explosivos Mocambique, which reportedly ordered the cargo. However, the firm had said it would only pay if the cargo got to Mozambique. It had placed an order via London, from a shadowy company selling fertilizer from former Soviet countries. Grechushkin, the businessman, has been questioned in Cyprus. Lebanese investigators asked police in Cyprus for permission to speak with him on August 6, according to reports. There the trail seems to end. All the multiple layers of companies linked to the ship, those which had a role, seem to have vanished or cannot be found. And no one seems to care. It is this lack of caring about a ship and its cargo that doesn’t add up. There should be a money trail related to the cargo and its associated vessel. When ships don’t reach their intended destination there are court cases and disputes. Even in the world of shipping, where shell companies registered in small countries like Panama re-flag ships to a third country like Liberia, there is still a money trail.A LOCAL looks at an image of her injured husband, August 14. (Hannah McKay/Reuters)Die Welt next enters our story. The German newspaper reported on August 20 that Hezbollah purchased ammonium nitrate that was possibly linked to the storage in Beirut. The paper obtained exclusive information from Western intelligence showing the terrorist group bought “large quantities of the dangerous substance.” This means Hezbollah had purchased similar quantities and asked for delivery of ammonium nitrate “closely related to the material detonated in Beirut.” Yet it is not known if the shipment is the same or a different one. The amounts delivered include 270 tons in July 2013, another 270 tons in October 2013 and then more in April 2014, Die Welt reported. These shipments involved large sums of money, some $500,000 in deliveries in those two years. The total amount of imported cargo would have exceeded 1,000 tons.Then came the August 21 discoveries of links between a shadowy bank and Iran. These reports were compiled by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP). They point to the vessel being owned by someone other than the Russian, asserting “Grechushkin only chartered the Rhosus.” This report says the ship was being leased via an offshore company in the Marshall Islands. “Documents show that the true owner of the Rhosus was Charalambos Manoli, a Cypriot shipping magnate. Manoli denies this, the report says. The Russian had leased the ship through a company called Teto Shipping, which had in turn chartered the ship “from a company in Panama, Briarwood Corporation, according to official records from Moldova’s Naval Agency.” The investigation revealed that a 2012 document showed that “Briarwood belonged to Manoli.” If this is confusing, it might be because it was designed that way in order to obscure the paper trail.Now Cyprus enters the picture, with stories of a “Cypriot businessman with ties to a bank used by the Hezbollah terror group.” Exit the Russians. Enter the African ties, a “hidden tycoon” and a “loan from a notorious bank.” That bank is in Tanzania. Tanzania is near Mozambique; however, the bank’s ties might have been with Iran, which backs Hezbollah. Questions now emerge about whether some of the ammonium nitrate was taken from the warehouse in the years before the explosion, which would point to shadowy hands manipulating the warehouse.OCCRP asserts that at the time of the ship’s voyage to Beirut, “Manoli was in debt to FBME, a Lebanese-owned bank that lost multiple licenses for alleged money-laundering offenses, including helping the Shia militant group Hezbollah and a company linked to Syria’s weapons of mass destruction.” The report says that Manoli had taken a loan to buy a different ship called the Sakhalin and was going to sell the Rhosus. “There is no evidence linking Manoli’s debt to FBME with the circumstances surrounding the Rhosus’s last journey.” This quote complicates the story further because it is unclear who owned the ship. Manoli told OCCRP that Lebanese authorities “confiscated the man’s [Grechushkin’s] ship over there and he declared bankruptcy... What’s the responsibility of this man [Grechushkin] if Lebanese authorities didn’t properly store the fertilizer?”The report also alleges that the ship was ordered to Beirut to take trucks on board to help pay for passage through the Suez Canal. A truck damaged the deck, after which the idea to load them stopped. There was a court case in Lebanon linked to the ship during which the captain and three crew members were effectively stranded on board for 10 months. There is another case linked to the ammonium nitrate. After the chemicals sat in Beirut for more than a year, a company called Savaro in Ukraine “hired a Lebanese lawyer to petition a local court to inspect the quality and quantity of the ammonium nitrate.” Around 1,900 one-ton bags were found to be “ripped and had their contents spilling out.” The report then notes that the Lebanese Customs Department asked the Lebanese Army to take control of the chemicals. That never happened. By July 2020, Lebanese security reportedly “warned that there were serious security flaws at the facility” where the nitrate was kept. A door was open and a hole in a wall of the warehouse was found. More concerning, it seems some of the ammonium nitrate might have gone missing. European intelligence sources “said the size of the explosion was equivalent to as little as 700 to 1,000 tons of ammonium nitrate.”The OCCRP report adds complexity to an already tangled web of questions. It seeks to show that the bank linked to the alleged owner was also linked to Iran and Hezbollah. It also seeks to show that the firm acquiring the chemicals in Mozambique also had questionable connections. Furthermore, it leaves questions about whether some of the ammonium nitrate was taken out of the warehouse. Linked to the other reports showing Hezbollah stockpiled ammonium nitrate in Europe and imported it to Lebanon, this would appear to mean that if Hezbollah wanted the chemicals, and if Hezbollah had infiltrated the Port of Beirut, it could have just quietly stolen the bags from the warehouse.LEBANESE PRESIDENT Michel Aoun meets with Lebanese Maronite Patriarch Bechara Boutros Al-Rai, at the presidential palace in Baabda on July 15. (Dalati Nohra/Handout via Reuters)NEVERTHELESS, THERE is no smoking gun, no evidence that Hezbollah sought to reroute the ship to Beirut and conspired to have the nitrate offloaded and the ship detained. The main question appears to be why such a high volume of the volatile chemical sat around for years, and why no one seemed to care. That the Rhosus was abandoned may not be as odd as it seems. Hundreds of tanker ships are scrapped every year, along with many cargo ships. For instance, there were seven ships sitting abandoned off the coast of the United Arab Emirates in 2019. This means that the murky paper trail for the numerous companies involved with the ship is not evidence enough of anything nefarious. But the lack of concern for the ammonium nitrate and apparent lack of interest by anyone to recover it or move it raise questions.Why would Hezbollah be seeking to import this product and also stockpiling it if it had access to a large supply at a warehouse at the port? Obviously the product was desired, and yet oddly, when it got to Beirut no one else wanted it. This doesn’t make sense. If days before arriving, companies around the world – including terrorist groups – were seeking ammonium nitrate, why is it that days after arriving, no one seemed to care that the chemical was there. Moreover, why was it abandoned for years? That the ship was abandoned and bankruptcy was declared is in line with how international shipping works. That suspicious banks and firms trade in ammonium nitrate and abandon ships is not in itself unique.However, the sudden lack of interest in all those tons of ammonium nitrate highlights the largest mystery: No one seems to have owned the chemical or made any attempts to take possession of it after 2013.The answer to that mystery, like the answer to who ordered the killing of Hariri, will continue to haunt Lebanon and the region.

The EU would focus on everything related to "activities we consider illegal", he added.Borrell spoke in Berlin where EU foreign ministers met to discuss support for Greece after Athens ratified a pact on its maritime boundaries to counter Turkey\'s claims to energy resources in the region.In a fresh sign of tensions, Turkey\'s Defence Ministry said Turkish F-16 jets on Thursday prevented six Greek F-16 jets which took off from the island of Crete from entering an area where Ankara is conducting maritime activity.Greek media reported that Turkish fighter aircraft had harassed Greek jets which were returning to base on Crete. Accusations and counter accusations on military issues are common between the two NATO allies.In Berlin, Borrell said the bloc was ready to sanction Turkish vessels, block their access to EU ports and cut off supplies.POSSIBLE SANCTIONS cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: \'36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b\' }).render(\'4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6\'); });"We can go to measures related to sectoral activities ... where the Turkish economy is related to the European economy," Borrell told a news conference, referring to possible sanctions.Turkey\'s foreign ministry said the EU had no basis for its stance and rejected Greek maritime claims. President Tayyip Erdogan told NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg Turkey will continue to protect its rights and interests everywhere."Our President told him NATO must fulfill its responsibility against unilateral steps which disregard international law and harm regional peace," Erdogan\'s office said in a statement.France has notably taken a tough stance on Turkey\'s actions in the eastern Mediterranean and French President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday this was to set red lines because Ankara respects actions not words.Borrell and German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said the EU first wanted to give dialogue a chance to cool tensions.Turkey is a formal candidate to join the EU, although its candidacy is at risk and could be withdrawn as a type of sanction, diplomats have said.Two senior EU diplomats told Reuters that foreign ministers agreed to leave any decision to EU government leaders, who are set to meet for a two-day summit from Sept. 24."Nothing will be decided before the September European Council," a senior diplomat said, although the envoy added that Turkey could also be rewarded with greater access to the EU\'s market of 450 million consumers if it curtailed its drilling.

The Institute for Monitoring Peace and Cultural Tolerance in School Education (IMPACT-se) examined 238 textbooks published within the calendar years 2016–20, used to teach grades 1-12, for its interim report: Understanding Qatari Ambition. The report, which found that Qatari education does not meet international standards, unveiled texts teaching children that Jews are evil and immoral, that they have manipulated world events including the First World War to their advantage, and that Zionism aims at achieving Jewish global dominance. "World War I helped the Zionist movement to enroll all the [warring] parties to its side, and offered promises in return for the support of Jewish Capitalism to this or that party. The movement worked in all directions to achieve its goals, whoever might win the war," the text in a 2017 Grade 12 social studies textbook read. An 11th grade social studies book from the same year taught: "Britain underwent a financial crisis during World War I, so the Jews exploited the situation, especially since they almost controlled the global economy, and through this they could stir the countries’ policies according to their own interests."The antisemitism on display draws on a range of influences, from antisemitic tropes found within classical Islam, to modern-era European antisemitism. Thus, a 2017 textbook quoted the Protocols of the Elders of Zion - a long debunked antisemitic conspiracy theory - as fact; the text reads: "It says in the Protocols of the Elders of Zion: We must win the woman, in the day she reaches out to us, and we won the case. Therefore, the Jews succeeded in directing Western public opinion, when they took hold of the [Muslim] women through media and through money."The report noted that later textbooks had removed references to the Protocols, however, the mentality behind the antisemitic trope was still in evidence in 2019, in texts that claimed the Balfour Declaration was designed to benefit the Jews at the expense of other nations such as Russia and Germany. "Jew-hate remains a central element of Qatari education. Textbooks teach Jews control and manipulate world powers and markets, are treacherous and killers of prophets," Marcus Sheff, CEO of IMPACT-se said.  cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: \'36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b\' }).render(\'4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6\'); });Global dominance was not the only antisemitic trope deployed. In a chapter about Jesus’ life, Jews are portrayed as sinners who practice polytheism, ignored his preaching, and conspired to kill him. Jews are also accused of deliberately destroying both Muslim and Christian holy sites within Jerusalem to disconnect the city from Islam and Christianity. However, Christians are also criticized, depicted as infidels and polytheists who will go to hell.In addition to teaching hatred of Jews, the curriculum actively promotes martyrdom and jihad. In line with textbooks seen in the Palestinian Authority\'s curriculum, Qatari boys are taught that Allah loves Jihadi fighters who die for his sake, while the girls are encouraged to do their part for their nation by having children and serving their husbands. The textbooks teach a mixed Salafi-Muslim Brotherhood version of Islam, although there was some movement away from this over the time-span looked at. Nonetheless, jihad is still considered the duty of men.\xa0 "Allah said: \'Indeed, Allah has purchased from the believers their lives and their properties [in exchange] for which they will have Paradise\'," 10th graders were taught in Islamic Education in 2018. A 7th grade book from the following year encouraged children to consider how well they have measured up to the example set by Mohammed, in a question asking: To what degree do I implement the moral skills and values that appeared in the field of Prophetic biography?" Children were asked to state whether they "follow the example of the Messenger of Allah in his steadfastness and Jihad," and their willingness to "defend the truth [i.e., Islam] with all the power I have" either always, sometimes or rarely.There are some nods toward modernism. Science and English textbooks include women in modern settings, however girls are taught that they must be brave, while serving the home and nation. "Good" women are those who please their husbands, have many children, and encourage their children to engage in jihad. Qatar is currently attempting to straddle the divide between an identity as an Islamic nation and forging links with the West. Consequently, while the curriculum is tightly linked to cultural and scientific interaction with the world, Qatar\'s involvement in world affairs includes a commitment to spreading political Islam globally. Democracy and political participation are praised, however, the Ottoman Empire is fondly described as the "Islamic State." Qatar\'s international positioning is also evidenced: The US, Britain, Turkey, Iran, China and Oman are considered friendly actors, although China comes in for criticism over its treatment of its Muslim minority. "There is much to be concerned about in the Qatari curriculum. For years, leaders have allowed their children to be exposed to one of the most radical Jihadi curriculums in the world," Sheff said. "Qataris are proud of their education system, which is heavily influenced by western educators. But the hate renders it unfit for the modern world. The Qataris have pumped over $1 billion into elite US universities since 2011. They might want to put some of that money into deradicalizing their own curriculum."

It is also building bases in countries such as Qatar and Somalia, seeking to become the leading military power in the Middle East with abilities to project power to Central Africa and Asia.In a speech on Sunday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey is starting space trials for a liquid-propellant rocket engine, Anadolu state-run news agency reported.Erdogan praised the defense company Rokestan for its abilities.

Turkey says these precision-guided munitions with GPS receivers have been produced domestically for the first time. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });Turkey is following Western, Chinese and Israeli achievements by building miniature weapons, hypersonic weapons and “directed-energy weapons.”The defense industry was working directly with the government, Erdogan said, adding: “We never accept products from abroad that we can make in the country.”The defense industry has been brought back to life, inspired by the country’s “glorious” heritage, he said.Turkey has been on a nationalist binge lately, with new threats to Greece and other countries, and it brags about historic battles and turning historic churches into mosques.Now, Turkey says it is one of the top makers of armed drones. “Our Bayraktar UAV can easily hit targets with its laser-guided 230-mm. missile system,” the report said.Turkey uses its drones against Kurdish fighters in Iraq and against adversaries in Syria and Libya. It wants to export them to Ukraine, Tunisia and other states.The US rarely exports armed drones, so countries such as Turkey and China have sponged up the market for these weapons.Turkey links its new advances to challenges in the Mediterranean, where it faces off against Greece, Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, France and the UAE.

Partial lists do exist, but only in Hebrew,” he wrote on the Avotaynu Online website, which covers “the origins of and migrations of the Jewish people.”“As I did in my recently published indexes of Cairo and Damascus Jewish surnames, I built the Baghdadi index by scouring the following eclectic collection of sources in the archives, in published works and in social media,” he added.Rosen, who served as ambassador to Jordan, extracted Baghdadi Jewish surnames from lists of exemptions from Ottoman military service in 1892-1899, the 1951 register of Baghdadi Jews whose Iraqi nationality was withdrawn, the Iraqi Jewish Archive (IJA) and a list of Baghdadi Jewish burials from 1949-2015.“As with most Jewish communities in the pre-1948 Arab world, the surnames of Baghdad’s Jewish community have not been comprehensively indexed until now,” he wrote. “The community, which numbered some 77,000 members in 1947, declined by more than 90% in only four years due to mass emigration, mainly to Israel. Emigration continued during the following decades, with a peak in the early 1970s. Today, only a handful of Jews remain in Baghdad.”“In the rush to depart, most Jewish communities’ vital records were left behind,” Rosen wrote. “These records were obtained by the local authorities and remain inaccessible to this day.”He also relied on a number of books: A History of the Jews in Baghdad by David Solomon Sassoon and Dictionary of the Baghdadi Jewish Dialect (in Hebrew) by Gila Yona-Sweary. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });“In many cases, I could verify whether a certain surname is Baghdadi by simply posting a question,” Rosen wrote. “I also found that the ability to search prior posts within the group, and the willingness of participants to respond to questions, enabled me to turn this wonderful social-networking resource into a robust tool for future research.”Among the Baghdad Jewry surnames Rosen found are: Abbada, Abd Alaziz, Abd Alnabi Abd Alrazzaq, Abu Almilh, Abu Alnil, Baba, Babai, Babi, Bakshi, Chaichi, Chitiat/Jitiat, Dabbas, Dabbi, Dabura, Daga, Dahan and Dahud.The complete list of surnames can be found on the Avotaynu Online website.

This was part of a strategy in which the US was seeking closer ties with Turkey as part of wishful thinking that Ankara would turn away from Iran and Russia and work with the US on regional issues.Instead, Erdogan hosted two high profile meetings  with the Hamas terrorists on Saturday.Ankara has granted Hamas members Turkish citizenship, and Hamas has plotted attacks on Israel from Turkey, according to news reports in the UK.Hamas is a designated terrorist organization, the US State Department said, and the officials Erdogan met with are “special designated global terrorists.”The US has promised a reward for capture of the terrorists, yet in Istanbul they were treated like foreign heads of state. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });“President Erdogan’s continued outreach to this terrorist organization only served to isolate Turkey from the international community, harms the interests of the Palestinian people and undercuts global efforts to prevent terrorist attacks launched from Gaza,” the State Department said in a statement, adding that it was the second incidence of such meetings, the previous one having taken place on February 1.Turkey has positioned itself as increasingly opposed to US policy, leading criticism of the US moving its embassy to Jerusalem and continually bashing Washington for its support of Kurdish fighters who defeated ISIS in Syria.Ankara has enabled ISIS members to flee to Turkey from Syria, and it previously detained a US pastor, harassed a US soldier and imprisoned a US Consulate employee. It has lashed out at foreign leaders, comparing Israel and European countries to Nazis, calling Europeans “spoiled children” and arguing that Turkey will carry out military operations wherever it wants.Turkey is increasingly challenging Greece in the Mediterranean, where the UAE sent F-16s on Tuesday to conduct a joint exercise with the Greeks. Israel has supported Greece in its standoff with Turkey.Over the past two years, Turkey has accused Israel of supporting terrorists, a label it applies to Kurdish fighters in the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces in Syria, and demanded the US withdraw from eastern Syria.US President Donald Trump spoke with Erdogan numerous times over the past two years and agreed to leave part of Syria last October.Today, the US continues to have a presence in eastern Syria, where it says it is securing oil fields. A recent deal with a US oil company appeared to cement those dealings. But Trump said he would make a decision about what to do in Syria fairly soon.This leaves a lack of clarity about the US’s Syria policy. Nevertheless, the US statements on Erdogan’s Hamas meetings appear to represent a shift in policy.

The root cause is decades of corruption and waste overseen by a political elite.Macron\'s visit coincides with Lebanon\'s centenary, at a time of profound doubts that it has a future as a viable state under the sway of former warlords and sectarian leaders loyal to different regional masters, Iran and Saudi Arabia.Macron made a series of phone calls to Lebanese leaders at the weekend that were vital to securing consensus on Adib."It was the pressure of his calls to everyone, the pressure of his coming to Lebanon, the pressure of everyone not wanting to upset him," a senior Lebanese politician said.A French presidency source said Macron was demanding "a government of mission, clean, efficient, able to implement the necessary reforms in Lebanon."Macron told journalists on Friday that the exceptional moment facing Lebanon led him to increase pressure."France has convinced its European and American partners and a good part of the regional partners that we are honest brokers," he said.Adib\'s name surfaced on Sunday when he was nominated by former prime ministers, including Saad al-Hariri who heads the biggest Sunni Muslim party. Under the Lebanese system, the post of premier must go to a Sunni.Hariri\'s Future Movement and the powerful Iranian-backed Shi\'ite party Hezbollah were among those nominating him.With Hariri\'s backing, Adib will enjoy more support than Hassan Diab\'s outgoing government, nominated by Hezbollah and its allies which together have a parliamentary majority.Lebanon won pledges of more than $11 billion in support at a Paris conference in 2018 conditional on reforms it failed to carry out.'}, {'id': '27f6ab07-ec25-11ea-8093-fdd8c08b34d7', '__typename': 'Article', 'createdAt': '2020-09-01T07:31:32.867Z', 'updatedAt': '2020-09-01T07:31:32.867Z', 'mercuryObj': {'title': "Iran's supreme leader tweets against iPhone imports on iPhone", 'author': None, 'date_published': None, 'dek': None, 'lead_image_url': 'https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/t_JD_ArticleMainImageFaceDetect/462543', 'next_page_url': None, 'url': 'https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/irans-supreme-leader-tweets-against-iphone-imports-on-iphone-639751', 'domain': 'www.jpost.com', 'excerpt': 'While many foreign technologies and services are banned in the Islamic Republic, Iranian officials have been caught using them themselves multiple times.', 'word_count': 257, 'direction': 'ltr', 'total_pages': 1, 'rendered_pages': 1, 'source': 'www.jpost.com'}, 'url': 'https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/irans-supreme-leader-tweets-against-iphone-imports-on-iphone-639751', 'category': 'armiger', 'subcategory': None, 'absSum': None, 'title': "Iran's supreme leader tweets against iPhone imports on iPhone", 'source': 'www.jpost.com', 'text': ' Iran\'s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei tweeted criticism against the import of iPhones into Iran from an iPhone on Sunday, according to Radio Farda.Khamenei criticized the half a billion dollar imports of iPhones in the previous Iranian calendar year during a video conference with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.\xa0Национальное производство – главный ключ к занятости, благополучию, росту национальной валюты.

Hezbollah wants to pose as being secure in its power and prepare to threaten Israel at a time of its choosing. It claimed it had a right to respond after one of its members was killed in Syria on July 20.What does Hezbollah say? Nasrallah responded to reports of a clash on Wednesday along the Israeli border near Manara with cautious statements about how “sensitive” the area is. Fars News in Iran said Nasrallah highlighted how Israel was on “alert.”His message is that he has foiled Israel and tricked it into remaining on alert and that Hezbollah can keep up the pressure. “An appropriate response will be made,” Hezbollah said. Israel’s “aggressive” actions will be answered, Nasrallah said this week while commemorating the importance of Ashura, a Shi’ite holy day, and the week’s events leading up to it.The tension comes amid Iran’s claims that it will let nuclear inspectors visit two sites. It also comes as Qatar sent an envoy to Gaza to try to reduce tensions with Israel. It was unclear if those tensions will be reduced. Hamas also sent leaders to Turkey this week, where they met Turkey’s president.It looks like a regional consensus is afoot with Turkey, Iran, Hamas and Hezbollah all seeking to push tensions with Israel, but on their own time and place of choosing. These groups all oppose the Israel-UAE deal and have watched US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo roam the region this week. He was in Israel, Sudan, Bahrain, the UAE and Oman.Meanwhile, Lebanon said it would file a complaint with the UN about this week’s border incident.

The Brooklyn-born Chabad rabbi in the United Arab Emirates has been helping to quietly build a Jewish community, which this month was able to emerge from its humble shadows.In a quiet suburb of Dubai, local Jews have congregated in the small villa that serves as their synagogue on Shabbat and festivals. That remained a closely guarded secret until this month’s historic normalization of relations between Israel and the UAE.The Jewish community started as an informal grouping that met on an ad hoc basis. In 2013, it developed into a formalized prayer group, which has conducted religious services for nearly every Shabbat and festival. Hundreds of residents and thousands of visitors have enjoyed the services over the years.Officially known as the Jewish Community of the Emirates (JCE), the Jewish community last February came together, drafted a constitution and appointed Ross Kriel as its first president and Rabbi Yehuda Sarna as its first chief rabbi.During a recent Zoom call with Israel’s minister of Diaspora affairs, Kriel said the Jewish community enjoys the steadfast support from local authorities.“It is wonderful to share this truth with the government of the State of Israel and the Israeli public,” he said. “We look forward to receiving [Diaspora Affairs] Minister [Omer] Yankelevich in the UAE and hope it will soon be possible for Israeli visitors to visit this beautiful country.”The Zoom call with the Israeli minister was “a day we will never forget,” Sarna said. “The first time a member of Knesset addressed the Jewish community in the UAE will be included in the history books.” cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });Duchman said he believes normalization with Israel is the beginning of a “new era not only for Jews in the UAE but for Jews around the world.”“While many Muslim countries look up to the UAE and see it embracing Israel, it will change the relationship of Jews and Muslims all around the world, from Golders Green [in London] to Brooklyn,” he said.The deal will change perceptions that both sides have had of one another for decades, Duchman said.“This is the opposite of the perceptions the community has had growing up of antisemitism, of synagogues closing, of that gap between the two peoples growing so much over the last 70 years,” he said. “So this is a huge deal to rebuild these bridges for the whole Abrahamic community.”Duchman has long dreamed of being a pivotal player in Jewish-Islamic relations. He already has done a lot despite his young age, having lived in the UK, Israel and Morocco before arriving in the Gulf state.“We’ve lived with Muslims through our history – Iran, Syria, Algeria, Mecca, so many countries – and we had a great history in the past,” he said. “I felt it was my duty to come and build those bridges.”Being among the Arab world’s Jewish communities is at the heart of the Chabad ethos. While many Jews in the region left and made aliyah upon the establishment of Israel, Chabad rabbis were sent to support those who chose to stay and helped ensure the communities not only survived but thrived.Duchman saw the results of this effort during his three years in Morocco, where he was part of youth programs and Jewish-Islamic outreach.But it is not only in the Emirates where his role is pivotal. In Bahrain, where there are fewer than 100 remaining Jews, he heads the Chevra Kadisha burial program and the country’s only Jewish cemetery. Five years ago, he conducted his first burial alone, which was a task that was not easy as a young rabbi, he said.Duchman is known internationally by his Chabad peers as a charismatic leader. Together with Sarna, he has taken the community out of the shadows.Last week, both rabbis and other representatives of the community held a Zoom call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to congratulate him on the success of the normalization deal.Rabbi Dovid Cohen, the director of Chabad South London Students and Young Professionals, said the Chabad hassidic movement was proud of Duchman for the work he has done in the Emirates.“This is very similar to the successes seen in the likes of Morocco and the former Soviet Union, where there are now over 500 centers,” he said. “Now, they are thriving Jewish communities.”The Dubai Jewish community is one of the most diverse in the world, reflective of the almost 200 nationalities calling the city home. Its members hail from Europe, the Middle East, South Africa and elsewhere. Prayer books are in several languages, including French, Spanish, German and Russian.The message of inclusivity and tolerance is what drives Duchman. “These people need a home, love, kaddish… I have to be here,” he said.In September, Duchman will receive his first rabbinic interns, four young men from the US, coming to learn about life among the Emirates community. He hopes it will be the first of many more.“It’s important rabbis should be in this region, see the UAE, feel the tolerance,” Duchman said. “After a month in the UAE, they take the experience back to their own community. Slowly, slowly, we can change the world.”When Duchman told his Brooklyn-based family he would be going on shlichus to the Emirates as a Chabad shliach, or emissary, they expressed some hesitation, fearful of sending their son into the unknown.Other than Bahrain, the modern Gulf was somewhat of a Jewish hinterland. Since then, Duchman has taken prominent members of the local Emirati community to meet his family in Brooklyn, and family members have visited the Emirates.It is through such powerful human connections that the kind of Jewish-Islamic relations he has dreamed of are coming to fruition, breaking down prejudices and stereotypes and building meaningful dialogue and connection.Life has changed greatly. In those early years, Duchman would discreetly wear his kippa forward on his head when in public, which, coupled with his traditional hassidic beard, allowed him to pass more as Laith (an Arabic name) than Levi.Now, The K Kitchen, a kosher catering company in Dubai, can be called Elli’s Kosher Kitchen; in the Armani Hotel in the world’s tallest tower, the Burj Khalifa, there is an Instagram account called @kosherdubai; and kosher wine has just been given the green light to be imported to the Emirates. Emirates Airline has kosher food provided by Chabad of Thailand.This is just the beginning. An Abrahamic Family House in Abu Dhabi, slated for completion in 2022, will house a mosque, church and synagogue, which is said to be the most expensive synagogue ever built.The community’s newfound freedom has been patiently awaited for some time. It was announced last year that Israel would have a pavilion at Expo 2020 – now postponed until 2021. Israeli athletes have been allowed to compete in the UAE capital.Solly Wolf, one of the leaders of the local Jewish community, has been in the Emirates for 20 years after first coming via his connections with the country’s rulers, to whom he sold textiles. The peace accord was unique, he said, because unlike other Arab countries, there are no memories of war between Israel and the UAE.“Here, it was only a media and political ‘war,’” Wolf said. There is much scope for the community to grow now, not only attracting business, tourism and scientific and technical collaboration, but a genuine sense of its becoming a destination for Jews to feel safe, he said.“It’s not been an easy process,” Wolf said. “But now, I can imagine that within the next few years, the community will grow in the thousands.” "}, {'id': '2a8ea30b-ec25-11ea-8093-fdd8c08b34d7', '__typename': 'Article', 'createdAt': '2020-09-01T07:31:36.964Z', 'updatedAt': '2020-09-01T07:31:36.964Z', 'mercuryObj': {'title': 'Lenient sentence for father who murdered daughter provokes outrage in Iran', 'author': None, 'date_published': None, 'dek': None, 'lead_image_url': 'https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/t_JD_ArticleMainImageFaceDetect/459751', 'next_page_url': None, 'url': 'https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/lenient-sentence-for-father-who-murdered-daughter-provokes-outrage-in-iran-640425', 'domain': 'www.jpost.com', 'excerpt': '14-year-old Romina Ashrafi was beheaded by her father in May, after she attempted to elope with an older man.', 'word_count': 436, 'direction': 'ltr', 'total_pages': 1, 'rendered_pages': 1, 'source': 'www.jpost.com'}, 'url': 'https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/lenient-sentence-for-father-who-murdered-daughter-provokes-outrage-in-iran-640425', 'category': 'armiger', 'subcategory': None, 'absSum': None, 'title': 'Lenient sentence for father who murdered daughter provokes outrage in Iran', 'source': 'www.jpost.com', 'text': " A father who beheaded his 14-year-old daughter for eloping has been handed a 9-year jail sentence, sparking outrage across Iran.

The pair were tracked down by police some 320km northwest a few days later, whom she begged not to return her, telling police she feared for her life. However, her father, as her legal guardian, had filed a complaint requiring the police to act, and Ashrafi was returned home. On May 21 Ashrafi was beheaded by her father with a scythe, as he felt she had shamed the family by running away. It later emerged that he had repeatedly asked his wife to persuade Romina to kill herself for having brought shame on the family. The sentence has sparked outrage on social media by Iranians who have claimed that, in rural communities, such killings are frequent and implicitly endorsed by the Iranian state. In some provinces, as many as one in five murders are classified as honor killings, The Guardian reported. The nine-year sentence has also been unfavorably compared to lengthy terms handed to women who protest the requirement to wear a hijab.

There are also plans to enhance capabilities for cloud computing. “When we put this infrastructure in schools, it allowed all the other students to come with computers,” he told The Media Line. “We call it BYOD – Bring Your Own Device. This is the physical infrastructure.”Yet for Dan Ben-David, president and founder of the Shoresh Institution for Socioeconomic Research and a professor in Tel Aviv University’s Public Policy Department, providing computers to students from sectors with fewer resources, such as the Arab and ultra-Orthodox communities, is not enough. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });“Just giving kids a computer doesn’t mean you are enabling them to use them by providing the internet and the technical support and everything else they need,” Ben-David told The Media Line. “There’s a major lack of preparedness in that regard.”The latest data for Israel from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) shows that in 2017, 22% of the country’s households did not have at least one working personal computer, and 25.9% lacked internet access.Meanwhile, more than 100 high school and college-aged students from abroad are scheduled to arrive in Israel on Sunday for the fall semester at Alexander Muss High School in Hod Hasharon, east of Tel Aviv. After landing at Ben-Gurion Airport, they will be transported to the school’s campus where they will undergo the required two-week quarantine. “Students will bring their own laptop computers from home,” Dr. Mark Shinar, the head of Alexander Muss, told The Media Line, adding that each classroom was equipped with a desktop for teachers to use for remote learning, as well as several extra computers when needed. Efforts are also underway outside Israel to provide pupils lacking key equipment or services.On Tuesday, Oman’s Sultan Haitham bin Tarik announced via the official Oman News Agency that he was ordering free laptops for low-income Omanis enrolling in colleges and universities for the academic year starting in September.About 17% of the Gulf state’s 43,000 higher education students registered for the fall semester will qualify.Shelly Culbertson, a senior policy researcher at the RAND Corporation who focuses on education in the Middle East, has a unique understanding of the challenges facing education systems in the region, having spent close to a decade working in Qatar, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. She says that in addition to the importance of internet and device penetration, a big challenge for the coming school year lies in training teachers to provide an online curriculum. “In the Middle East, teacher training has historically been very weak. In some countries, the qualification to be a teacher is an associate degree, not a bachelor’s degree,” Culbertson told The Media Line, adding that the ability of some teachers to use computers might be limited.

It’s sad to see that some of our Arab brothers are helping the Trump administration in its effort.”Another official told the Post that the main purpose of Pompeo’s visit was to help Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump. “The Trump administration has shown that it is ready to do its utmost to bolster Netanyahu’s popularity,” the official said. “The visit is also aimed at helping Trump get reelected by presenting a major diplomatic achievement in the Middle East. The Americans and the rest of the world need to understand that without the Palestinians there can be no real peace in the region.”The officials said the Palestinian leadership has no intention to end its boycott of the Trump administration.On the eve of Pompeo’s visit to Israel, PLO Secretary-General Saeb Erekat published an article titled “The birth of Arab Zionists” in which he lashed out at the policies and decisions of the Trump administration and the recent normalization agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates.Referring to Pompeo’s October 11, 2019, speech to American Association of Christian Counselors in Nashville, Tennessee, where the secretary of state talked about his “walk with Christ” and role as a “Christian leader,” Erekat wrote: “Extremist Christian Zionism has appeared in many forms: support for Israel and its advancement as opposed to the backwardness and corruption of the undemocratic Arabs and Muslims. This is one of form of justifying support for Israel. Their use of religion reached the point where US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that he was walking with Christ in order to legalize settlements, recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and annex Palestinian territories.” cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });Erekat was referring to Pompeo’s statement late last year that “the establishment of Israeli civilian settlements in the West Bank is not per se inconsistent with international law.”Commenting on Arab support for the Israel-UAE deal, Erekat asked: “Are we witnessing today the overt birth of the Arab Zionists? Whoever reads what is written by those who defend the UAE’s decision to recognize Israel finds glorification of Israel, its freedom and its advancement. Some [Arabs] have even said ‘Palestine is not my cause’ and ‘Israel is a loyal ally.’ They are also hurling insults at the Palestinian people for their lack of loyalty, their ungratefulness and the corruption of Palestinian leaders, all because the Palestinian people insisted on their adherence to the Arab Peace Initiative, the Arab League Charter and the Charter of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, as well as the Charter of the Gulf Cooperation Council, and international law, and the rejection of the Emirates’ decision, which was accepted only by the writers of palaces and the owners of paid pens.”The UAE’s decision to establish normal relations with Israel, Erekat charged, “is more than a stab of a poisoned dagger in the Palestinian back, because we believe in the Arabism of our cause and our Arab national security, and the Palestine Liberation Organization did not accept that it be a tool in the hands of entities or systems that tried to use it.”Erekat pointed out that the Palestinians said no to the Trump administration, knowing that they might pay a financial and political price because the US “has the tools of pressure and influence over states.”The PLO’s Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) claimed that Pompeo’s visit to the region aims to advance Israel’s plan to apply its sovereignty to portions of the West Bank and promote normalization between the Arab countries and Israel.Hassan Abdel Hamid, member of the DFLP’s political bureau, said that Washington’s effort to convince more Arab states to establish ties with Israel was designed to exert pressure on the Palestinians to return to the negotiating table with Israel and accept Trump’s “Peace to Prosperity” vision for solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Abdel Hamid warned the Arab states not to engage in normalization activities with Israel and to abide by the resolutions of Arab summits and the Arab Peace Initiative, which states that such a move would be taken only after a full Israeli withdrawal to the pre-1967 lines and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with east Jerusalem as its capital.

What a huge danger Iran would be to the entire world if it did get a nuclear weapon," Netanyahu told Raab, according to a statement released by the premier\'s office.Iran has repeatedly denied seeking nuclear weapons.

The IAEA should have been given access to these sites already in mid-2018 when the agency was informed about them, they said.Instead, IAEA director-general at the time, Yukiya Amano, sat on the issues for an extensive period, ostensibly to check the information’s veracity.However, being that the information came directly from Iran’s own secret archive, many in Israel interpreted Amano’s delay as an attempt to placate Tehran and potentially give it time to remove any incriminating material from the sites in question.Next, even once the IAEA started demanding access, it took months before it publicly criticized Iran in March for noncompliance. It was not until the end of June that the IAEA Board of Governors voted to condemn Iran’s noncompliance for the first time in nearly a decade.In other words, so much time has passed that Israel assumes Iran has long since sanitized the sites and is partially agreeing to access now because everything has been covered up.But this is only part of the answer since after the June IAEA vote, several Israeli officials made high-profile statements supporting the agency’s condemnation of Iran.The bigger picture is that Israel is looking for effective restrictions on the ayatollahs’ nuclear program.A vote condemning Iran and potentially threatening UN Security Council action could help achieve that goal.Israel does not merely want inspectors to have “anytime, anywhere” access to Iranian nuclear sites. It also wants to extend the 2015 nuclear deal’s restrictions beyond their expiration dates, limit Iran’s ballistic-missile testing and support of terrorism in the region and to halt its progress with advanced centrifuges that can speed up the process of enriching uranium for a nuclear bomb.In contrast, a deal limited to just these two sites does not address any of the other fundamental issues.It is also possible that one reason Iran agreed to provide access at this point is that it has just successfully routed the US twice at the UNSC – once regarding the conventional-arms embargo issue and a second time with the US attempt to snap back global sanctions.With these much-bigger diplomatic victories over the US, Tehran may feel more comfortable in showing flexibility on the relatively technical and narrow issue of access to these two nuclear sites.When the attention was on Iran withholding access, the nuclear standoff could be framed as the rogue Islamic Republic playing another game of concealment with the international community and might have led to a more general rally against the ayatollahs.Put differently, the IAEA-Iran dispute had regained the diplomatic high ground for Israel and the US to focus on: What is Iran hiding?If Iran is no longer hiding anything, this path of diplomatic attack has run its course at the same time that Tehran has won much bigger victories and may be close to outlasting US President Donald Trump.There are also some remaining technical objections.Iran also was supposed to resolve questions surrounding nuclear material the Mossad found for the IAEA at Turquzabad, and it was unclear from the deal how or when this would be addressed.Also, some IAEA visits have been timid and symbolic, with Iran collecting samples “on behalf” of inspectors, and the deal did not reveal how or when access would be given.But Israel unquestionably is more worried about whether this deal signals a reduction of pressure on Iran on the big-ticket issues than it is about any of the specific details involved.

This is one of many incidents involving US patrols in eastern Syria being harassed by Russian forces.These confrontations are often filmed by Russians or by Syrian regime members on the ground or others and appear to be designed to embarrass the US by showing that Moscow is able to derail US patrols in Syria by either running their vehicles off the road or now harassing them with helicopters.\xa0 The White House, unusually in this instance, put out a statement by National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot, saying that, “at approximately 10 a.m. (Syria Time), August 25, a routine Defeat-ISIS Coalition security patrol encountered a Russian military patrol near Dayrick, in northeast Syria. During this interaction, a Russian vehicle struck a Coalition Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected All-Terrain Vehicle (M-ATV) causing injuries to the vehicle’s crew.” The site of the incident was in a town called in Arabic Al-Malikiyah but called Derrick or Dayrick in Kurdish.\xa0 The US operates patrols in eastern Syria. Since October 2019, Washington has said it shifted its efforts to secure oil fields in eastern Syria, after withdrawing from an area along the border with Turkey. The US in Syria has backed the Syrian Democratic Forces, a group of fighters who defeated ISIS in Raqqa in 2017. The SDF was spearheaded by Kurdish fighters and has grown to include Arabs, Christians and other groups. However the US-led coalition that is fighting ISIS – and has helped arm and train some 80,000 SDF fighters – is facing a crossroads in Iraq and Syria. In Iraq, the Coalition left the large Taji base and a half dozen other smaller bases in six months as tensions with Iranian-backed groups grew and rocket attacks against US forces became a weekly threat.In Syria, the US seems to have a new company doing an oil deal but the Trump administration is unclear about a long-term commitment. President Donald Trump says he wants to end “endless wars” in what he calls far-away places. He told West Point military academy graduates in June that America was reticent to continue its role in these places.\xa0 ENTER THE Russians into the equation. Moscow, sensing that the US wants to leave, is seeking to pressure it in Syria the way Iran pressures it in Iraq. Russia already has agreements with Turkey to partition parts of northern Syria and is selling Ankara its S-400 system. Turkey got the US to leave the border areas in October 2019, and now Russia hopes to muscle the US out of other areas. The Russian footprint in Syria is small, with a handful of vehicles in eastern Syria, but the US footprint is also small. So their\xa0 contingents do a game of cat-and-mouse with these patrols. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });Washington says it wants to “de-escalate the situation” and that after the recent confrontation, the “coalition patrol departed the area.” For Moscow, this likely looks like a propaganda win. It tends to send people to video these incidents on ride-alongs, hoping to capture an incident with the US that will make it look weak or embarrassed. That could mean showing pro-Syrian regime protesters confronting American forces, or showing a helicopter harassing a patrol.The US has said that its patrol faced “unsafe and unprofessional actions like this” which “represent a breach of de-confliction protocols, committed to by the United States and Russia in December 2019.” The US says its forces “retain the inherent right and obligation to defend themselves from hostile acts. The international coalition’s mission in northeast Syria is to ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS.” However, it took Washington a long time to issue this statement, which was put out to represent how seriously the White House takes this situation. This time, there were injuries, unlike in the past. Images of a Russian helicopter harassing the US patrol have been on social media since August 26. Video also shows the Russian and US vehicles chasing each other through a field. The US chairman of the Joint Chiefs also spoke to his Russian counterpart. Although the US provided no details of the conversation, it appears to relate to Syria.\xa0 THE INJURIES could cause more tension with Russia but could also just as likely lead to a quiet agreement to reduce these clashes of patrols for a period of time. Moscow has a way of pushing the envelope on various issues in Syria, often in concert with Turkey even when they seem to be at odds. Its goal is to appear stronger than it is, using just a few vehicles with the Russian flag to illustrate its commitment to the Syrian regime and securing areas in Syria. The clash with the Russians comes amid a visit to Turkey this week by US Syria envoy James Jeffrey, who is pro-Turkey. At the same time, the US State Department has sidelined its own SDF partners from any meetings, as part of a diplomatic process to end the Syrian conflict. While Jeffrey claims the Syrian opposition includes voices from eastern Syria, it appears that Kurdish voices have been systematically discriminated against due to pressure from Ankara. Turkey claims the SDF is linked to the Kurdish PKK which it calls a terrorist group. Some American voices want the US to withdraw from eastern Syria, arguing that the successful war on ISIS and work with the Kurds was part of an Obama-era policy that should be ditched. Others fear that if the US leaves, the Syrian regime will enter the vacuum.

He is a member of the Justice and Development Party (PJD).Turkey is concerned because Morocco is one of the countries where there are hints of possible better ties. Ankara knows Morocco and Israel have had connections in the past.On Saturday, Turkey’s media also highlighted Sudan’s opposition to normalization, pointing out that a spokesman had been pushed out after hinting of ties with Israel. Turkey says the Communist Party in Sudan rejected “any deal to normalize relations with Israel.”In Turkey, the far-right regime of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is opposed to communist views but it seems Turkey is happy to highlight communist parties so long as they oppose Israel. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });The country also highlighted Kuwaiti NGOs for opposing normalization.

The twisted rebar hanging in spiderwebs from blown-up buildings; the blackened Ottoman villas; cavernous holes where homes used to be in sharp relief against the cerulean sea, its color the very blue of childhood; the former Paris of the Middle East once again the realm of the displaced and the dispossessed as dazed residents emerge from the ruins.I’ve seen this movie before. It reminds me of the last time I was in Lebanon almost 30 years ago, when Beirut was still reeling from 15 years of civil war. In 1992, armed with a Hi8 camera and an arts council grant to do a documentary employing Augusto Boal’s “theater of the oppressed” work with “children of war” in Beirut, I returned to a land my ancestors had fled for Canada in 1906. Instead of Turkish gunboats following me, as my Greek Orthodox great-grandparents had to contend with when they left their homeland for strange new shores, I was followed by Syrian agents from the Mukhabarat (Military Intelligence Directorate). Suspicious of my videographic forays into the flattened downtown, they threatened the distant cousins I was staying with in Achrafieh, who – already chagrined at my collaboration with a young Shi’ite filmmaker – kicked me out unceremoniously after a few days.I was 25 years old and this was my first time in the Middle East. I had spent most of my grant on my camera and was now homeless in a ruined city. As I interviewed Muslim and Christian children on either side of the old Green Line – kids whose families were too poor to leave their war-torn land – and wove their stories into psychodrama, I lived my own. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });The writer in her ancestral village of Karound in the Bekaa Valley, April 1993 (Credit: Ouday Raad)I SPENT a few nights at the home of a Palestinian cameraman who lived with his parents and four brothers in a two-room house downtown. There was sporadic electricity, no potable water, and at night we all slept on the living room floor. I made my bed at the far end next to his mother, who slept next to his father and the brothers. I moved on to a cheap hotel in Hamra, and began to work with children in the Sabra and Shatila camps who had survived the 1982 massacre, when hundreds of mostly Palestinians and Lebanese Shi’ites were killed by the predominantly Christian Lebanese Phalange members – with the Israeli army nearby. We discussed their dreams and turned them into theatricalized moments. One boy told us of a recurring dream where he transformed into Superman – with a keffiyeh for a cape – and flew home to Jerusalem to reclaim his grandfather’s house, clutching the keys in his hand. The children reenacted the dream on the same spot where many had been orphaned in 1982.One evening when I walked back to my hotel room, I was followed by a man in an unmarked car, who seemed to think we were both in a John le Carré novel. I turned to lose him and he turned to follow. I ran back to my little hotel/sanctuary, heart pounding. How disappointed he would have been if he had ransacked my room and found no evidence of espionage, but only old family photos and earnest poetry about returning to my roots.\xa0I moved on to an abandoned villa in the old Jewish quarter, a brief moment of luxury until the water and electricity were cut off, and spent afternoons interviewing Khadijah, a 12-year-old girl whose family – displaced from the south after the Israeli invasion – slept in a bombed-out school on the Green Line, just West of the “Muslim” boundary in Chiyah. The dream she recounted was a recurring nightmare about a wedding party interrupted by gun-toting militiamen who started shooting. In our Augusto Boal-inspired reenactment, she stopped the men from entering and everyone just kept on dancing. The youngest of six children, Khadijah – in spite of living in the ruins of one – did not actually attend school, as her family couldn’t afford the fees. During a filming session in her neighborhood, where I recorded some boys playing war games (complete with pretend bazookas), I asked Khadijah why she didn’t play with them. She replied that she didn’t like the boys’ games because they reminded her of the war. She told me that she had seen her mother die in front of her when their building was shelled in the late 1980s. She recounted how her father had been kidnapped by a militia around that time during the Amal/Hezbollah conflicts, and almost buried alive in a graveyard. Since Khadijah and her family had been displaced by the Israeli invasion of their southern Lebanese village, they’d been constantly on the move. At night she slept with a small amulet inscribed with Koranic verses – a gift from her grandmother – on her pillow, a kind of talisman she’d kept with her all through the troubles. When I asked her what her idea of peace was, she said, “having a home that no one would ever chase you from.”Khadijah lived across the street from Ayoub, a 14-year-old boy who resided on the “Christian” or east side of the Green Line boundary in Ain al-Remmaneh, the civil war’s ground zero. Although their respective homes were 100 yards apart, Ayoub and Khadijah had never met until I introduced them. Even though the war was ostensibly over, neither child had ever dared venture to the “other side.” Khadijah imagined it was dirty and full of garbage, while Ayoub was afraid to cross over because he thought the area was haunted by ghosts.Ayoub and his family literally lived with the militias for several years of the war, as their apartment building was a barricade for the Forces Libanaises. Ayoub gave me a tour of his neighborhood, which still bore the marks of its frontline location. Makeshift sandbag barriers with crosses painted on them stood like relics of war. Ruined houses of friends and neighbors betrayed their original domesticity with old empty soup cans and half-melted stoves. Ayoub’s war stories ranged from the sublime tragedy of family and friends being killed to the absurdist horror of an Iranian aid worker accidentally urinating on a land mine. Ayoub couldn’t afford to attend school and instead helped contribute to the family income by collecting and selling old mineral water bottles. His name is the Arabic version of Job.When my Shi’ite filmmaker friend Ouday and I brought Ayoub and Khadidjah together in the “neutral” space of the Russian Cultural Center in Verdun for more Boal-inspired drama therapy, the two became fast friends. Ouday Raad and the writer with the village goatherd, who lost half his herd when one stepped on a landmine in 1982, Karoun, April 1993 (Credit: Hadani Ditmars)I FINALLY found a refuge of sorts in the unheated Hamra apartment of an American journalist on leave. Unfortunately, on a trip to my ancestral village of Karoun in the Bekaa Valley on Lebanese Independence Day in November, a sleep-deprived Syrian midwife had scalded my foot with the piping hot coffee she was serving me in her home. I ended up with a third-degree burn and the village doctor – who had “acquired” his “degree” from a “Bulgarian medical school” during the war – did not treat it properly. \xa0I survived only because a friend of Ouday – a young Shi’ite man named Ali involved in a Romeo-and-Juliet story with a Maronite girl – insisted on driving along the treacherous snowy roads back to Beirut with no snow tires and past Lebanese army checkpoints blocking our path. Once back at my freezing Hamra flat, Ouday arranged a visit to the local fire chief – the resident burn expert. As he brought out a gruesome photo album of burn victims he had treated during the war, his wife rather unnervingly served the requisite dark coffee with cardamom and then casually ripped off my makeshift bandages, declaring that gangrene had set in. After a month alone in the flat unable to walk, and a few weeks of penicillin, I returned to my theater-of-the-oppressed duties. Someone had stolen the telephone line, but I had managed to survive on boiled water and canned goods from the journalist’s pantry. When the downstairs neighbors were repairing their apartment, I crawled down the stairs to retrieve discarded pieces of timber to use as firewood. Once back on my feet, to support myself after the arts council funds had dried up, I got a gig at a French restaurant singing gypsy songs and Leonard Cohen dirges. Stories of the Street (written in Franco-era Spain but well-suited to postwar Beirut) seemed like the obvious song to keep the darkness at bay:“The stories of the street are mine, the Spanish voices laugh.The Cadillacs go creeping now through the night and the poison gas. And where do all these highways go, now that we are free?Why are the armies marching still that were coming home to me?”One night, as I sang “Ochi Chernye” (“Dark Eyes”), Druze leader and car-bomb survivor Walid Jumblatt walked in and began to sing along. I had entered into some kind of weird Lebanese gestalt and there was no turning back.Full of childhood horror stories and hoping to somehow help the kids I worked with, I met with foreign-aid workers and wives of arms dealers running charitable foundations, in vain. One day I was given a contact with a prominent Christian MP and arranged an appointment. When I asked if he could help fund my project and showed him some video footage, he remarked, “What are you doing with these dirty, displaced children? There are plenty of cleaner and better-educated Lebanese children to talk to.” Then he asked me for a date the next weekend, when his wife was away.Nonetheless, I persevered, tilting at windmills. I got a gig singing Arabized flamenco at a joint on Makhoul Street just down from the Blue Note in Hamra with the legendary engagé oud player Sami Hawat, who used to play with Marcel Khalife, composer of “Beirut Our Star” – inspired by the poetry of Mahmoud Darwish. I can still hear the song in my dreams:In secret we sing:\xa0Beirut is our shelterBeirut is our starBeirut, shape of shadeShe tempts us with a thousand overturesAnd with new alphabetsBeirut our only shelterBeirut our only starWhen the American journalist returned to claim her flat, I decamped to the home of Ouday’s cousin in the Southern suburbs, where larger-than-life cut-outs of Hezbollah leaders made for a surreal Shiah Disneyland effect. After nine months, I finally left, my heart full of stories and dashed hopes, and a large scar on my right ankle where Lebanese hospitality had almost killed me. Like my ancestors who fled the Turks, I never went back.IN THE Karoun home of the village haji, who claimed to have fought in the Ottoman army, April 1993. (Credit: Ouday Raad)I NEVER knew the in-between Beirut of gleaming shopping malls and Starbucks spots and returning expats and Instagram photos. My Beirut was the one of coffee at Wimpy’s amid buildings pockmarked by bullet holes and street kids selling chewing gum in Place des Martyrs; of mid-century ruins on top of archaeological ones, before the downtown was bulldozed by the Solidere development company, erasing memories with shiny new towers.Now that the ghosts of war have returned – not that they ever really left – I wonder what happened to those children I worked with almost three decades ago.As UNICEF declares that 80,000 children have been made homeless by Beirut’s latest disaster, I wonder what has become of Khadijah and Ayoub?Of the children of Sabra and Shatila? Of the displaced of the downtown? Where are the boys I once visited who lived amid the ruins of the St. George Hotel, damaged during the civil war and then blown up again by the bomb that killed prime minister Rafic Hariri and 21 others in 2005? Have the street kids I used to photograph at Place des Martyrs been replaced by young Syrian refugees? Or have they joined the ranks of angry protesters hoping for decent state services, for a life, for a future; legions of the dispossessed trying to take back the dream and change the ending, locked in a slow-motion nightmare of repetition.My old Hi8 cassettes full of the children’s songs and stories are in a closet somewhere, gathering dust; my would-be documentary foiled by inertia, lack of funding and the ennui of potential broadcasters overwhelmed by other war stories in other places. But now as I watch CNN, I’m sure I spot a familiar face in the crowds of wounded, reeling citizens, amid specters of past explosions and phantom invasions, resilient kleptocracies and perennial proxy wars. As carnivorous nations once again gather to divide your spoils, the trauma of memory rises up from the ashes, over the sea and out from the screen. I remember you, Lebanon. I see you. And I sing a lament for an orphaned land.\uf03cThe writer is the author of Dancing in the No-Fly Zone: A Woman’s Journey through Iraq, a past editor at New Internationalist, and has been reporting from the Middle East on culture, society and politics for two decades.

Until a new administration is agreed, the Diab government continues in a caretaker capacity.Lebanon\'s financial crisis has sunk the currency by as much as 80% since October, locked savers out their deposits in a paralyzed banking system and fueled poverty and unemployment.Lebanon launched talks with the International Monetary Fund in May, after defaulting on its huge debt, aiming to secure financial support but these have stalled amid divisions on the Lebanese side over the scale of losses in the financial system.

"The government of Lebanon is responsible for what transpires within its territory. In the upcoming months, we will closely watch how UNIFIL’s renewed mandate is implemented, and determine whether there is a justification for the force’s presence.”UNIFIL has come under heavy criticism in recent years from both the US and Israel, who have argued that its mandate fails to fully empower it to operate as an observer force against Hezbollah.They are particularly concerned by the mandate’s failure to ensure that UNIFIL can search for terror tunnels that Hezbollah has built along the border to attack Israel.Israel and the US would like to see the mandate expanded to include, among other things, the ability for UNIFIL to enter homes in southern Lebanon to search for entry ways to tunnels.Israel in particular has argued that unless the peace-keeping force is fully empowered, there is little point in maintaining its presence on the border.While there is broad support for UNIFIL among the 15 UNSC member states, there is sharp division with regard to the mandate under which it operates. The US is one of five permanent members on the Security Council which have veto power.France, overseeing the resolution\'s progress at the United Nations, circulated a final compromise draft on Thursday, which will be put to a vote on Friday afternoon.The troop ceiling was lowered from 15,000 to 13,000 to meet a key US demand, though one diplomat called that a symbolic change as only 10,500 troops are currently deployed.Reuters contributed to the report.

But in Yemen the number one problem now is funding," Norwegian Refugee Council head Jan Egeland told Reuters.Five years of war have killed more than 100,000 people, and left 80% of the population reliant on aid and millions on the brink of famine."Children are sick.

Hamas representative Khalid al-Qaddumi was also present, the report said.The Mehr News discussion attacked the “betrayal of the UAE in the signing of the agreement to normalize relations with the Zionist enemy.” Qaddumi said the agreement has crossed a redline and Israel is now more secure than in the past.The extremists asserted that Israel was like a criminal running free without anyone to put it on trial. He pointed out that when Egypt had signed a peace deal with Israel, the Arab League had suspended Egypt and moved its headquarters temporarily from Cairo. Egypt was readmitted to the Arab League in 1989.Hamas is outraged, the representative told Iran.“Nations and our educated class have a great responsibility in questioning friendly countries for normalizing relations.” He said the “Zionist regime is an enemy and will remain an enemy. The destiny of the [Zionist] regime is destruction and decay, and whoever has a relationship with it will be transferred to the dustbin of history.”The PIJ representative connected the current state of affairs in the Arab world to the era of 1979 prior to the Islamic Revolution, adding that the region needs a revolution like the one brought by Muhammad’s grandson Imam Hussein, who is venerated by Shi’ites. PIJ is a Palestinian group but often acts as an Iranian proxy. Although it is made up of Sunnis, it has adopted Iran’s Shi’ite iconography in these statements. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });“Today, the American project is a project of infidels,” said Abu Sharif. “Unfortunately, the Arab governments are being won over by the projects of the United States and the Zionist regime… the governments are corrupt without exception.” He called for a revolution in the region against the recent trend of normalization of ties.Overall, the comments appear to represent desperation on behalf of Iran and its allies among the Palestinians. The attempt to try to rekindle a revolutionary spirit like in 1979 or to encourage the Arab League to react as it did then is far-fetched.The interview nevertheless represents Iran’s attempt to spread slander against the UAE and also to encourage discord and protests in the region. So far there have been few protests against the UAE-Israel agreement.

He became acting leader after Badie\'s arrest in August 2013.An interior ministry statement said Ezzat had been arrested from an apartment used as a hide-out in Cairo\'s Fifth Settlement district, and was accused of joining and leading a terrorist group and receiving illicit funds.Egyptian authorities accuse the Brotherhood of promoting militancy and subversion, accusations it strongly denies.The interior ministry said encrypted communications equipment had been seized during the arrest, and said Ezzat was suspected of overseeing several assassinations or attempted assassinations as well as a bombing since 2013.A Brotherhood statement denounced the arrest, saying Ezzat had been pursued on "false political charges" and that the group would "overcome such strikes and challenges". cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: \'36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b\' }).render(\'4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6\'); });Ezzat had previously been sentenced to death and to life in prison in absentia.

Herzl “Herzi” Halevi flew to Doha on Monday along with other officials from the IDF, Shin Bet, Mossad, and National Security Council to convince Hamas leaders abroad to intervene to prevent a military escalation.While Egypt has been playing the main role in mediating the crises, the report said the IDF wants to see Qatar play a larger role in mediating, and not just send financial aid to the group.Qatar is the main financial provider to Gaza, periodically sending millions of dollars to Hamas every month for the past two years with Israel’s approval to pay for fuel for the Strip’s power plant, as well as to pay the salaries of the group’s civil servants and provide aid to tens of thousands of families.Doha first began sending $5 million per month, later increasing it to $10m. and then to $20m. This year it started sending $30m. According to reports, Hamas is demanding another increase, $40m. every month in cash on a regular basis, to extend to a “pre-determined long-term period of time.”Halevi made a similar visit in February when he flew to Doha on a visit with Mossad chief Yossi Cohen, which lasted less than a day.During the visit, the two met with Qatari envoy to the Gaza Strip Mohammed al-Emadi and Qatari national security adviser Mohammed Bin Ahmed al-Misnad, reportedly “begging” the Qataris to keep sending money to Gaza. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });Doha is also making great efforts to prevent an escalation between Israel and Hamas, “conducting intensive talks on the highest level with the goal of preventing an escalation, and to protect the residents of Gaza from more crises and blows,” Emadi said.The report came as tensions continue to rise, with the IDF attacking targets belonging to Hamas every night for close to two weeks.Defense Minister Benny Gantz visited an Iron Dome battery deployment site in Israel’s southern region on Monday alongside Commander of the IAF Air Defense Division, Brig.-Gen. Ran Kochav.During his visit, Gantz spoke with soldiers on staff and was briefed on the division’s operations. Early Monday, Israeli jets, tanks, and drones attacked Hamas posts and underground infrastructure in response to the continued launching of incendiary and explosive balloons, which caused 28 fires on Sunday.Though rescue services say most of the fires were small and did not pose a danger to human life, they have destroyed dozens of hectares of brush.Groups in the Strip have responded by firing rockets toward the South, injuring several Israelis and causing the IDF to deploy additional Iron Dome batteries.

He was also the first US secretary of state to visit the country since Condoleezza Rice in 2005.Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok told Pompeo on Tuesday that his country’s government was not mandated to normalize ties with Israel, its cabinet spokesman said in a statement.The Sudanese premier said he held “direct and transparent” talks with Pompeo, including about Sudan’s removal from the list.Hamdok reaffirmed to Pompeo the importance of separating normalization of ties from a US decision on removing Sudan’s designation as a state sponsor of terrorism, spokesman Faisal Saleh said.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with Sudanese leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan in February and announced that they would take steps toward normalization. In March, Sudan began allowing flights on their way to Israel to enter in its airspace.The evening before Pompeo left Jerusalem for Khartoum, Hook and Ortagus said Sudan’s blacklist status and the possibility of ties with Israel are not necessarily connected. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });“We support both objectives on their own merits; it’s not any more complicated than that,” Hook said. “We would like to see them normalize and, if they can meet the criteria, would like to see them no longer a state sponsor of terror.”Sudan has been trying to get off the list “for quite some time,” Ortagus said. “When you’re on the state sponsor of terrorism list, there’s a legal process to get that designation moved. The Sudanese are very vocal about their desire to get off of that list, and that’s the path people should be working towards. Responsible states should want to be off that list.”In recent years, Sudan has sought to break away from Iran’s orbit. Tehran previously had access to Port Sudan on the Red Sea for its naval forces, and Iranian ships have previously transferred arms to Gaza through Sudan and into Egypt. This was one of the key supply routes for Hamas as it built up its capacity to wage war against Israel.Because of the civil war in Yemen, Sudan decided that it would no longer maintain a pro-Iranian orientation. It has since aligned its foreign policy with Saudi Arabia. As a result, Hamas lost its Sudanese line of supply.While on Sunday, Pompeo tweeted that “the democratic transition underway is a once in a generation opportunity for the people of Sudan. Looking forward to discussing how to deepen the US-Sudan relationship.” "}, {'id': '363ded83-ec25-11ea-8093-fdd8c08b34d7', '__typename': 'Article', 'createdAt': '2020-09-01T07:31:56.559Z', 'updatedAt': '2020-09-01T07:31:56.559Z', 'mercuryObj': {'title': 'UN to renew Lebanon peacekeeping mandate, reduce troops', 'author': None, 'date_published': None, 'dek': None, 'lead_image_url': 'https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/t_JD_ArticleMainImageFaceDetect/445590', 'next_page_url': None, 'url': 'https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/un-security-due-to-vote-on-extending-unifils-mandate-640322', 'domain': 'www.jpost.com', 'excerpt': 'UNIFIL has come under heavy criticism in recent years from both the US and Israel.', 'word_count': 705, 'direction': 'ltr', 'total_pages': 1, 'rendered_pages': 1, 'source': 'www.jpost.com'}, 'url': 'https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/un-security-due-to-vote-on-extending-unifils-mandate-640322', 'category': 'armiger', 'subcategory': None, 'absSum': None, 'title': 'UN to renew Lebanon peacekeeping mandate, reduce troops', 'source': 'www.jpost.com', 'text': ' The UN Security Council (UNSC) decided on Friday to extend the mandate for a peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon by another year, but will reduce the number of troops in the region amid US and Israeli criticism over the mission\'s efficiency.The council added several demands from the government of Lebanon to allow UNIFIL to operate more efficiently after efforts from Israel and the US\xa0to strengthen to force\'s authority in the face of Hezbollah activity. \xa0 These new demands include an enhanced reporting mechanism to the UN for violent incidents and violations; a call for the Secretary-General to create a detailed action plan to optimize the force’s effectiveness; and a strong condemnation of attempts to hamper the force’s freedom of movement and of threats posed to UNIFIL troops.The UN Interim Force in Lebanon, which this year numbered over 11,000 personnel, has acted in southern Lebanon since 1978. As of 2006, it was tasked with monitoring compliance with UN Resolution 1701, which set out the terms of the ceasefire that ended the Second Lebanon war.“Today we end a long period of UNSC complacency on the UNIFIL peacekeeping mission in Lebanon and the growing, destabilizing influence of Iran and the terrorist organization Hezbollah,” US ambassador to the UN Kelly Craft said in a statement. “Today’s resolution is a step toward improving the mission’s effectiveness and access.”She added that reducing UN peacekeeping troops from 15,000 to 13,000 is an important step toward right-sizing the mission. “UNIFIL will also have prompt and full access to sites necessary to contain Hezbollah and diminish its vast arsenal of weapons,” Craft continued.“The Trump Administration will scrutinize UNIFIL to ensure these improvements are made,” she said. “We hope the reforms will spotlight actors who blatantly obstruct the mission and put peacekeepers and the people of both Lebanon and Israel in harm’s way.” cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: \'36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b\' }).render(\'4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6\'); });“The Security Council decision comes as a last warning for the Government of Lebanon. If Hezbollah continues to turn southern Lebanon into a base for its terrorist activity under UNIFIL’s nose, the Government of Lebanon will be held responsible and will bear full responsibility for any escalation of tensions or the grave consequences of such actions.”\xa0 Israel’s Ambassador to the United Nations Gilad Erdan said.“Israel will not allow terrorist attacks to emanate from Lebanese territory and will respond with force to any such crime. The Government of Lebanon is responsible for what transpires within its territory. In the upcoming months, we will closely watch how UNIFIL’s renewed mandate is implemented and determine whether there is a justification for the force’s presence.” Erdan continued. UNIFIL has come under heavy criticism in recent years from both the US and Israel. The two countries have argued that UNIFIL’s mandate fails to fully empower it to operate as an observer force against Hezbollah.They were particularly concerned by the mandate’s failure to ensure that UNIFIL can search for terror tunnels that Hezbollah has built along the border to attack Israel.Knesset Deputy Speaker Sharren Haskel (Likud) wrote a letter to the UNSC in advance of the vote in which she urged the members to either reform UNIFIL or dissolve it.“I ask you to renew it only after reexamining UNIFIL tasks and directives and providing their troops with the authority and means to carry out their mission,” wrote Haskel, who also chairs the Knesset Foreign Affairs Subcommittee.“It is crucial that under a renewed mandate UNIFIL forces will no longer need to request permission or coordinate the entering and searching of areas, compounds and bases within the territory under their supervision in the south of Lebanon. Be it a Lebanese military base, Hezbollah stronghold or private property.“The lack of access and request of permission prevents them from finding weapons and strongholds of active terrorist cells,” Haskel explained.“In addition," she wrote, "alongside standard and ineffective military equipment and routine, UNIFIL forces will have to be equipped with proper surveillance and security technology for intelligence gathering and territorial scouting, in order to achieve proper deterrence which is most important.“Without a reform in both authority and equipment I have little hope that UNIFIL will be able to maintain any influence on the Lebanese-Israeli border and certainly will continue to have no effect as a peacekeeping force.” '}, {'id': '3754fe9a-ec25-11ea-8093-fdd8c08b34d7', '__typename': 'Article', 'createdAt': '2020-09-01T07:31:57.448Z', 'updatedAt': '2020-09-01T07:31:57.448Z', 'mercuryObj': {'title': 'Lebanon’s Maronite Patriarch confronts Hezbollah', 'author': None, 'date_published': None, 'dek': None, 'lead_image_url': 'https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/t_JD_ArticleMainImageFaceDetect/462867', 'next_page_url': None, 'url': 'https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/lebanons-maronite-patriarch-confronts-hezbollah-640555', 'domain': 'www.jpost.com', 'excerpt': 'Al-Rai is potentially putting himself in the cross-hairs of conflict.', 'word_count': 413, 'direction': 'ltr', 'total_pages': 1, 'rendered_pages': 1, 'source': 'www.jpost.com'}, 'url': 'https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/lebanons-maronite-patriarch-confronts-hezbollah-640555', 'category': 'armiger', 'subcategory': None, 'absSum': None, 'title': 'Lebanon’s Maronite Patriarch confronts Hezbollah', 'source': 'www.jpost.com', 'text': " Lebanon’s Maronite Patriarch Bechara Boutros Al-Rai is at the center of controversy in Lebanon after reiterating his call for the state to crack down on unauthorized weapons in the country, an apparent critique of the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah. \xa0Since a massive explosion destroyed the Port of Beirut and killed more than 150 in the beginning of August, the Christian leader has been more outspoken. He wants elections, and he has critiqued the “political class” that is entrenched in power. Lebanon is facing a major “danger,” he said over the weekend.This comes as the country chooses a new prime minister and government and as French President Emmanuel Macron is again scheduled to visit.Rai has called for the state to confine all weapons under its control and that of the army, Abu Dhabi-based Al Ain News online reported. This comes after armed clashes with Hezbollah supporters last week, as well as concerns that the terrorist group is storing 150,000 rockets and munitions throughout the country.In response, pro-Hezbollah voices have slammed the Maronite leader, claiming he is supporting “peace” and is linked to Israel. This is an attempt to link him to the UAE-Israel deal and make it appear as if he supports “normalization.”In fact, the stance of those around Rai is that Lebanon should not be part of regional conflicts; it is Hezbollah that has hijacked Lebanon and forced it to be part of the “resistance” against Israel.Unsurprisingly, the increased tension and lack of government leadership has put religious leaders at the forefront. The Maronites are the traditional Christian leaders of Lebanon. But they also found themselves at the forefront during the civil war in the 1970s and ’80s, and many of their leaders have been assassinated. In addition, the president of Lebanon is always a Christian, and the current president, Michel Aoun, is also pro-Hezbollah. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });This potentially puts the patriarch in the crosshairs of conflict. Fifteen years ago, Hezbollah members plotted and carried out the murder of former Lebanese prime minister Rafic Hariri. A UN investigation accused four Hezbollah members and found one guilty last month.Rai’s criticism of illegal weapons caches in recent weeks is controversial and could put him on a collision course with Hezbollah. He has been treading carefully in the wording of his sermons and speeches in this respect.But Lebanon is often a powder keg. In addition, many regional countries want to inflame tensions in the small country sandwiched between Syria and Israel.

The current government of Egypt under Abdel Fatah al-Sisi views the Brotherhood as a terrorist group. The Brotherhood is also considered a terrorist group in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.However, Turkey’s ruling party has close links to the group, as does Hamas in Gaza and Qatar’s monarchy, meaning the battle with the Brotherhood is part of a regional conflict.The Muslim Brotherhood came to power in Egypt after the fall of Hosni Mubarak during the Arab Spring protests. However, it only governed for a year under former president Mohammed Morsi. Pushed from power during mass protests in 2013, Morsi died in 2019 while on trial. His death was condemned by Turkey.Countries that oppose the Islamic group have encouraged the Trump administration to declare it a terrorist group similar to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The US has not done so.Egypt has largely seen the Brotherhood disappear from the country’s civil society since its overthrow and a crackdown. In 2015 Mahmoudd Gozlan, the group’s spokesman, said the group would respond nonviolently to the crackdowns. His son has also been arrested. The lack of violence by the group is notable.This was considered surprising at the time, because past eras of Egyptian history have shown that these types of groups can lead to uprisings and terror attacks. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });The radicalization that led to the murder of Egyptian president Anwar Sadat and also led Egyptian fugitives to support al-Qaeda was part of that process in the past. Today, however, Egypt’s only real insurgency is ISIS attacks in Sinai. Ezzat avoided authorities for seven years, despite being 76 years old. He faces a death sentence.Ezzat has been here before. He was detained in 2005 as well during roundups of his group. He was accused in 2010 of having realigned the group’s ideology with Sayyed Qutb, the former leader who was executed in the 1960s.What becomes of the Brotherhood now? It has supporters at the highest levels in Turkey and also in Qatar, as well as Hamas and among the government of the National Accord in Libya. It has also had supporters in Kuwait, Sudan and Jordan among other states. In July, a court in Jordan dissolved a Brotherhood-aligned party.A report in Al-Ain in the Gulf notes that the group has a supreme administrative committee that has sought to move elements of the leadership aboard. This means that it can operate from Turkey, Qatar or other places. The report says that Egyptian security services found encrypted programs on phones and computers after the Ezzat raid.The capture of Ezzat is considered a blow to the group, even though it is not clear what Ezzat has been up to for the last seven years or how he has controlled the group, given the full power of the Egyptian security forces arrayed against it.In the past, these kinds of arrests of senior figures have strained tensions with Turkey. Egypt has already warned Turkey about increased intervention in Libya and has ratified a deal with Greece over managing the Mediterranean, which is a way to keep Turkey from its own claims and deals with Libya.Clearly, Egypt and Ankara are on a collision course, one that will also involve allies of both countries. Egypt’s allies include Greece, Cyprus, the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Israel, which has a peace deal with Egypt and now an agreement with the UAE, is also on the side of Cairo and Abu Dhabi. Turkey, Hamas and Qatar oppose this alliance, as does Iran.

According to Greek Reporter, the Greece-UAE drills “send an unmistakable signal to anyone who might think of challenging Greece that the nation is far from alone in defending its borders.”Israel maintains broad cooperation with Greece and has participated with it in several military exercises, especially following the downgrading of Jerusalem’s ties with Turkey. “The Greeks are a major and natural strategic partner,” a senior international cooperation officer told The Jerusalem Post recently, adding that “someone had to fill the empty spot when we stopped doing drills with the Turks.”As tensions continue to escalate between Greece and Turkey, Athens has been working to strengthen its maritime capabilities. In May Israel and Greece’s defense ministries signed an agreement for Israel to lease IAI Heron UAVs to Greece for border defense.Greek ONEX Neorion Shipyards and Israel Shipyards have also signed a cooperation agreement for the construction of next-generation corvette ships for the Greek navy.The agreement, which was signed during the recent visit by Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis to Israel on June 16, will see up to six Themistocles-class corvettes be built based on plans by Israel Shipyards, based in Haifa.The Themistocles design is reported to be “basically the same design” as Israel’s Sa’ar 72 mini-corvettes, but with modifications according to the needs of the Hellenic Navy.\xa0\xa0\xa0  "}, {'id': '38cecc89-ec25-11ea-8093-fdd8c08b34d7', '__typename': 'Article', 'createdAt': '2020-09-01T07:32:00.909Z', 'updatedAt': '2020-09-01T07:32:00.909Z', 'mercuryObj': {'title': "UAE hits back at Israel deal critics: 'Nothing but fear and hate'", 'author': None, 'date_published': None, 'dek': None, 'lead_image_url': 'https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/t_JD_ArticleMainImageFaceDetect/462795', 'next_page_url': None, 'url': 'https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/uae-hits-back-at-israel-deal-critics-nothing-but-fear-and-hate-640315', 'domain': 'www.jpost.com', 'excerpt': 'The UAE took to Twitter to accuse Iran, Qatar and Turkey in particular of being wedded to a worldview defined by conflict and antisemitism.', 'word_count': 530, 'direction': 'ltr', 'total_pages': 1, 'rendered_pages': 1, 'source': 'www.jpost.com'}, 'url': 'https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/uae-hits-back-at-israel-deal-critics-nothing-but-fear-and-hate-640315', 'category': 'armiger', 'subcategory': None, 'absSum': None, 'title': "UAE hits back at Israel deal critics: 'Nothing but fear and hate'", 'source': 'www.jpost.com', 'text': ' The United Arab Emirates\' US embassy hit back at the critics of its recent deal with Israel, taking to Twitter to slam Iran, Turkey, Qatar, Hamas and Hezbollah, among others, for their negativity.

Among them was a quote by the Turkish Foreign Ministry which commented that "the consciences of the peoples of the region will never forgive the hypocritical behavior of the UAE, which betrayed the Palestinian cause."Similarly, the Iranian Foreign Ministry had said: "The Islamic Republic of Iran considers Abu Dhabi\'s shameful move to normalize relations with the fake, illegitimate and anti-humane Zionist regime as a dangerous measure. ... The Emirati government and the other governments siding with it must accept responsibility for all of the consequences of this move."But the UAE pushed back, accusing the critical voices of not being interested in coexistence and regional stability.

Their rants say something about what kind of world they want to see," before going on to highlight analyses by the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) and the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), showing that the main critics had been linked to three sources: Iran, the Palestinians, and Qatar. The MEMRI report quoted Saudi journalist Mishari al-Dhaidi praising the agreement between the UAE and Israel, comparing it to article in the Qatari daily Al-Sharq, titled "...This Is How The Palestinian Cause Became A Pawn In The Hands Of Bin Zayed." In that article, the Qataris harshly criticized the UAE for describing Hamas as a terrorist organization, and for accusing Hamas of holding the people of Gaza hostage. "In this context, it is impossible to ignore the UAE\'s campaigns of maligning and renouncing the Palestinian cause," the article read. Meanwhile, a report for the ADL by David Andrew Weinberg noted: "Peace always has its opponents, and this agreement is no exception. [...] The vast majority of these materials [criticizing the deal] come from media outlets linked to one of three sources: Iran (or its proxies), the Palestinians, and Qatar.\xa0 Although the subset of these examples linked to Iran tends to be the most extreme, certain materials from all three places seem to be fundamentally hostile to Israel or propagate intolerant stereotypes."

Hezbollah categorically denied having anything to do with the incident.The Lebanese army, which was heavily deployed in the area on Friday, said the problem spiraled out of a row over a poster put up by Shi’ites to commemorate Ashura, the 7th century martyrdom of Imam Hussein.The army statement said the problem that erupted was between members of the Arab Khaldeh tribes and residents of the area, without identifying them.The violence triggered a flurry of contacts among Lebanese politicians seeking to contain tensions. The country is still grappling with the aftermath of the Aug. 4 port blast which killed 180 people and the financial crisis seen as the biggest threat to stability since the 1975-90 civil war. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: \'36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b\' }).render(\'4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6\'); });Mourners chanted "there is no God but God and Hezbollah is the enemy of God" as the boy’s body was carried on a stretcher into his grandfather\'s house at funeral on Friday.Men in facemasks fired AK-47s in the air.Divisions between Lebanese Sunnis and Shi\'ites opened up after the 2005 assassination of Rafik al-Hariri, the former prime minister. Rifts emerged again after a U.N.-backed tribunal recently convicted a Hezbollah commander, Salim Ayyash, of conspiracy to kill him.Hezbollah denies any role in killing Hariri, Lebanon’s main Sunni leader at the time of his death.A building set on fire during the fighting was still smoldering and its windows were peppered with bullet holes.“We (will) take our rights with our own hands,” Riad Zaher, the tribe’s leader, said. He expressed doubt the authorities would bring anyone to justice. “We know that the government will take them in one door and let them out the other," he said.Denying any Hezbollah link to the incident, a spokesman for the group referred to the army statement and said “throwing around accusations recklessly is totally rejected.”"This is not the truth that security apparatus know and the people of the area know," Mohammad Afif, the spokesman, said.Located on the highway to the south, the Khaldeh area is home to Sunnis, Shi\'ites and Druze.\xa0DISMANTLING THE STATEAli al-Shahine, a spokesman for the Arab Khaldeh tribes, accused Hezbollah supporters of recently trying to put up a picture of Ayyash.A military source and Hezbollah denied this had happened.After the tribunal\'s ruling, people in Ayyash\'s village briefly put up a picture of him. Hezbollah told them to remove it to ease tensions, a member of the group said.The Future Movement led by Hariri’s son, Saad, urged the Arab Khaldeh tribes to heed his call for self-restraint and said the incident was the result of “unregulated weapons and futile provocations”.It is the second deadly shooting in a week.Three men were shot dead in the village of Kaftoun in northern Lebanon on Saturday. A Syrian man has been arrested and two Lebanese suspects are on the run over that incident, a security source said.“The sporadic rise of violence is another sign of the dismantling of the state,” said Mustafa Alloush, a Future Movement leader. “I expect that similar or other types of violence will rise from now on,” he told Reuters.Al-Akhbar, a pro-Hezbollah newspaper, said political tensions had started to spill into the street.“The ‘battle’ of Khaldeh ... gave a clear indication that the game in the street will quickly go out of control to burn the whole country,” it said.

He nevertheless stressed that “the United States has a legal requirement with respect to qualitative military edge, and we will continue to honor that.”Though Washington has been selling Abu Dhabi millions in military deals, they have been bound to preserve Israel’s qualitative military edge (QME) in the Middle East before selling any advanced weaponry to regional states.US President Donald Trump’s administration has said the normalization agreement between the UAE and Israel could allow the Gulf state to clinch unspecified new US arms sales, and the UAE, which is among the world’s biggest defense spenders, is currently in the process of building up its armed forces.But it might not only be the UAE that ends up requesting Washington sell them the advanced jet.So might the other Arab countries that have signed peace accords with Israel: Jordan and Egypt, the latter of which might already face American sanctions for its recent $2.5 billion purchase of 4.5 generation SU-35 fighter jets from Russia, since Washington won’t sell them the F-35s. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });And what about Saudi Arabia? Will the possibility of getting such jets be that last push the kingdom needs to sign a similar normalization deal with the Jewish state?Since Pompeo has said Washington will continue to make sure Israel retains its QME, what can or will Israel demand in return for the UAE receiving F-35s.Will it be the F-35B short takeoff/vertical landing (STOVL)?Israel has expressed interest in the past in acquiring the F-35B, which has the capabilities for vertical takeoff and landings, an option that can allow the jet to land on much shorter runways if the IAF’s bases are attacked by Iranian jets or missiles from Hezbollah.But, a senior Israel Air Force officer who was personally involved in the decision to purchase the F-35s told The Jerusalem Post recently that the disadvantages of the plane are greater than the advantages.“It can extend the range of the air force and gives more opportunities that would enlarge the operational envelope of the IAF, but it carries fewer weapons,” he said.So what about the V-22 Osprey?The IAF is also once again looking at procuring Boeing’s V-22 Osprey despite budgetary issues, as it believes there is an operational need for between 12-14 aircraft that can take off and land like helicopters but fly like fixed-wing planes.The multi-role combat aircraft uses tiltrotor technology, combining the vertical performance of helicopters (such as takeoff and landings) with the speed, altitude and range of fixed-wing planes, making them the ideal aircraft for sensitive missions since they don’t need runways.But the UAE also wants the V-22, so we can rule out that purchase to retain Israel’s QME.Maybe the F-22 Raptor?The F-22 is an advanced tactical fighter aircraft developed for the US Air Force and is considered the first 5th-generation fighter after it entered service with the USAF in 2005.Using low observable technologies and modern avionics, the F-22 has been designed to rapidly project air dominance with stealth and range. The supersonic jet can be armed with an M61A2 cannon, six AIM-120 AMRAAMs, two AIM-9 Sidewinders, two 1,000-pound GBU-32 Joint Direct Attack Munitions and two AIM-120s.Flown only by the USAF, if sold to Jerusalem the F-22 can without a doubt maintain Israel’s QME in the Middle East.But maybe Israel doesn’t need aircraft to keep it’s QME, what about advanced heavy weaponry like the GBU-57A/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator or the GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB)?The MOAB, nicknamed the Mother of All Bombs, is considered the largest non-nuclear bomb in the USAF’s inventory and was used only once against Islamic State terrorists, dropped on a deep tunnel complex in eastern Nangarhar Province in Afghanistan.Both bunker busters are in use only by the US and would provide Israel with the ability to effectively destroy Iranian infrastructure deep underground.Selling the F-35 to the UAE would reduce Israel’s regional superiority – especially if other Arab countries follow suit. But there are several options available and more will likely come up that Washington can sell Israel to maintain it’s QME.It’s not the end of Israel’s reign of power in Middle Eastern skies.

(res.) Amos Yadlin, former IDF intelligence chief and currently head of the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), spoke to Nissim Mashal on his 103FM radio show on Friday and discussed the tension in northern Israel relating to the Hezbollah organization. According to Yadlin, the Lebanese terrorist organization understands that it can\'t touch civilians, but "is determined to kill IDF soldiers." Yadlin said that "Hezbollah won\'t dare touch civilians, and it\'s trying to change the rules so it\'s allowed to hurt IDF soldiers. We must be loud and clear and make it understand that we won\'t play this game."\xa0 \xa0The INSS head addressed the recently growing concerns of a Hezbollah attack. "I believe Nasrallah is determined to kill IDF soldiers. He is looking for a focused blow that won\'t necessarily cause an escalation. He\'s failed three or four times already, and he\'s not giving up. "There\'s a big similarity between the northern and southern borders and there are also differences," he explained. "On both fronts, there\'s a delicate dialogue going on, trying to determine the equation and the rules of the game. No one on either side wants to reach a full-scale confrontation. The difference is that in the South, civilians are being attacked and the IDF needs to make sure that it stops. Hamas is extorting us," Yadlin said. Unlike the situation with Hamas, Yadlin says that "in northern Israel the rules are a bit different – the civilians are safe. Hezbollah knows that it can\'t touch civilians but it\'s trying to harm IDF soldiers. It\'s trying to tell us: \'You can\'t attack the Iranian establishment in Syria. If by chance a Hezbollah terrorist is hurt in Syria, you\'ll pay the price.\' "What am I concerned about? I think they\'re succeeding," he said. "Since July 20, I\'ve seen around seven aircraft reaching Hezbollah from Syria or Iran, probably with ammunition, and Israel is not attacking."  cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: \'36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b\' }).render(\'4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6\'); });WHEN ASKED why it looks like the powerful IDF is afraid of a conflict with a terrorist organization, Yadlin said that "on a strategic level, the IDF\'s reluctance to retaliate against the terrorist on Har Dov is interpreted by Nasrallah as weakness and may lead him to make a larger gamble that will lead to escalation. "I think we were wrong not to at least publish the documentation of the terrorist arriving," he said. "It would be fine to let them leave once, but as soon as it\'s clear that Nasrallah keeps reading us in the wrong way, the IDF must do what its chief of staff keeps preaching: achieve a crushing victory. Which will explain to Hezbollah that this game it\'s playing is not acceptable – and it will surely not cripple us in our efforts of preventing Iranian establishment in Syria."Regarding the attack on Hezbollah\'s weapons and ammunition warehouses in Lebanon, Yadlin emphasized: "This is the most important discussion that the national security cabinet needs to ask itself, but it\'s busy with other issues, which also don\'t lead to any decisions. "For 15 years, the slandered war in Lebanon achieved a very good situation in northern Israel," he said. "Civilians are protected. There are 14-year-old children in Kiryat Shmona that have never seen a shelter. Hezbollah is trying to change the rules and make IDF soldiers its new targets. We need to be clear in saying that we won\'t accept that."Yadlin concluded the interview by sharing his opinion on how the IDF should respond and determine ground rules that will make Hezbollah understand that initiating an offensive operation is not worth it. "We keep signaling that we don\'t want to reach a third Lebanon war, but there\'s a delicate balance between not doing anything and providing encouragement. Hezbollah made a mistake in 2006 and it may make another one. At this point, we\'re escalating the situation more than containing it," Yadlin said. Translated by Tobias Siegal.

Either way the Middle East is changing - analysis', 'source': 'www.jpost.com', 'text': " Is it a peace deal or a normalization deal?It is a question many people have been wondering over the last two weeks, ever since Israel and the United Arab Emirates announced a historic deal to formalize diplomatic relations between the two countries.On the one hand, peace would make sense. The UAE is an Arab country in the Middle East, and like many others, it has rejected acknowledging Israel’s existence until now.On the other hand, how can there be peace when there was never war? For there to be peace between countries, they would have first needed to have been hostile with one another.Thankfully, that was never the case between Israel and the UAE. Yes, the UAE refused to publicly open diplomatic ties with Israel. But it never fought Israel, like in the case of Egypt and Jordan, two countries that fought multiple wars against the nascent Jewish state with the declared goal of destroying it.When deals were reached with both – Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994 – those accords heralded in an era of peace. Weapons were put down, border crossings were opened, and embassies were established.With the UAE, there are no weapons that need to be laid down. Jerusalem and Abu Dhabi have never been at war and have never had an openly hostile relationship. Unlike Egypt, which fought Israel in 1948, 1956, 1967 and 1973, the UAE has never fired a missile at Israel or threatened its existence. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });This difference is exactly why no matter what you call it, the deal with the UAE has the potential – for the average Israeli – to mean a lot more than the previous peace deals with Jordan and Egypt.While Israel’s peace with Jordan and Egypt are both pillars of stability for the Middle East – they have enabled Israel to downsize its defense budget, to invest in other areas and to focus on other threats – they mostly manifest on a government-to-government level.When it comes to people-to-people, though, there is very little exchange, very little tourism (except for the Sinai) and very little trade (except now for gas).With the UAE, there is no bad blood. There is no bad history. The PLO didn’t find refuge there and use it to launch attacks against Israel, like in Jordan, and its military forces didn’t fire artillery shells at Israeli communities, like from Egypt. Instead, it is a country with which Israel can start a clean slate and build a new alliance.While Israelis have gotten used to the cold peace with Jordan and Egypt, the relations that were being built in Abu Dhabi during the historic visit on Monday are expected to be warm between two nations whose peoples are already looking forward to respectively visiting and investing in Dubai and Tel Aviv.And who knows? Maybe the warm ties that Israel establishes with the UAE will trickle across the region to the average Jordanian and Egyptian. So, whatever you call what is happening, it doesn’t make that much of a difference. The Middle East is changing before our eyes.

But the Iranian regime tries to hijack the events every year, using the symbolism of martyrdom, battle and “uprising against oppression” to link its regional role to the historic Islamic period.In Karbala, Iraq, thousands have gathered to commemorate Hussein, who was killed in 680 fighting the forces of the Caliph Yazid.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani gave a long speech commemorating Ashura and the holy days, linking the current Iranian struggle with the US to the past.The battle of Karbala is a reminder of the need to seek justice and to struggle against deviation in the path of religion, he said. The uprising of Hussein against oppression is a symbol for non-Muslims around the world, he added.Iran has sought to push its version of Islam throughout the Middle East and the world, including more ceremonies in Syria and other places than in the past.“We always need the culture of Ashura, especially today in the face of all conspiracies, especially from the United States,” Rouhani said. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });In general, Iran’s use of imagery linked to Ashura shows Hussein fighting against mobs and armies of what are supposed to be “oppressors.” Despite his defeat, his legacy lives on, and for the most part, his killers are depicted as some kind of combination of Arabic tribes and modern-day Islamist extremists.It is an odd juxtaposition that is meant to make Iran appear to be a heroic civilized nation fighting against savages. In this iconography, recent “martyrs” such as former Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who were both killed by the US, join the pantheon of Iranian “martyrs.” Their images dot highways and airports in areas where Iran has influence.“The resistance of the US against our diplomats will fail... The US suffers defeat after defeat at the UN Security Council,” Rouhani said. Iran defeated a US attempt to end an arms embargo, he said.Rouhani discussed Iran’s attempts to defeat US sanctions and the struggle against COVID-19. His speech had elements of messianic devotion to it, including the idea that Iran’s regime and its allies in Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq, Gaza and Syria are on a historic mission and entering unique times.Rouhani was largely seen as a “moderate” when elected. But his regime has suppressed protesters, rapidly built new ballistic missiles, attacked countries in the region and uses religion wrapped in nationalism and militarism just like its predecessors did.This nation is subject to Imam Hussein, this nation is the follower of the same Imam, and all should now be afraid, Rouhani said.“When the day of Ashura came and he [Hussein] saw in front of him the huge [enemy army] of 30,000 gathered, he was not afraid to say, ‘Allah, you are a trustworthy God, you are my refuge, I seek refuge in you in troubled times,’” he said.If the US wants to understand the mentality it is contending with, it should listen to Rouhani’s speech, which indicates Iran’s regime is not entirely deterred and believes it is on a historic mission. Its belief is bolstered by its own media coverage of support it is getting from other countries.

This is not a one-sided deal.”Gantz stressed that Israel’s QME would not be at risk and that he would make sure the deal signed by Israel and the UAE would allow Jerusalem to maintain its security interests.“I have said, and I will repeat, we will know as a security establishment how to accompany this deal while maintaining Israel’s security interests, especially in regards to our QME... I will take care of Israel’s security,” he said.US Presidential Adviser Jared Kushner on Monday defended the possible sale of F-35 advanced stealth fighters to the UAE, saying the US would maintain Israel’s QME.“The military relationship America has with the UAE is very special just like the relationship between Israel and America,” he said after landing in Abu Dhabi. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump would discuss the possible sale of F-35s, he added.Washington has been selling Abu Dhabi millions of dollars’ worth of military equipment, but it has pledged to preserve Israel’s QME in the Middle East before selling any advanced weaponry to other states in the region. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });Gantz would not discuss what Israel may ask from the US should the F-35 be sold to the UAE.“We know what we want to ask for and what we might be able to get in order to make sure that we can act professionally and strategically with the developments in the Middle East,” he said.When asked if there could be any positives to the Gulf state procuring the jet, Gantz said a possible coalition could be one, provided Israel’s QME was maintained.“Yes, it could be that there might be something like a possible coalition that might be positive,” he said. “Others would say that it is better that they have American weapons systems rather than Russian or Chinese. But there are always two ways it can go.”Gantz spoke to his Emirati counterpart, Mohammed bin Ahmad Al Bawardi, last week. On Monday, he told the Post he expects more phone calls to take place between the two of them. No date has been set to meet, but “it doesn’t matter where the meeting will happen, here or there,” he said.Gantz said he was very pleased with the diplomatic developments and appreciative of what Netanyahu, Trump and Kushner had done.“The agreement is not only good for UAE and Israel and not just bilateral,” he said. “It can cause a positive domino effect. Anything to advance peace in the Middle East, or at least normalization, must be welcomed.”Gantz said it was improper that he was not told of the deal in advance, but what mattered was that it was made.“There is a difference between a basic surprise out of nowhere, being astounded, which is not what this was, and a situational surprise that it happened now,” he said.Opposition leader Yair Lapid congratulated Netanyahu and said he hoped other countries would follow. But Yisrael Beytenu leader Avigdor Liberman, who is also in the opposition, criticized Netanyahu.“Any agreement with an Arab country is undoubtedly important, but this is not peace for peace, as Netanyahu claimed, but normalization for Netanyahu conceding on sovereignty in Judea and Samaria and the Jordan Valley and a silent agreement on America selling the UAE F-35s,” Liberman said.The full interviews with Gantz, Lapid and Liberman will be published in The Jerusalem Post's Rosh Hashanah supplement.

Unlike a number of other countries in the region, notably Iran and Qatar, Riyadh has not issued public criticism of the normalization agreement. The alternative to passing through Saudi airspace would require the flights to take a slightly longer route across Iraq before heading south east down the length of the Persian Gulf. The flights won\'t be the first time aircraft from the UAE have landed in Israel - in May, the inaugural direct flight from Abu Dhabi landed at Ben-Gurion. However, that was a cargo flight, laden with humanitarian aid for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. Celia Jean contributed to this report.

Their family members were brutally murdered or maimed in terrorist attacks perpetrated by the Hezbollah terrorist organization,” and Iran.Shurat Hadin president Nitsana Darshan-Leitner wrote that, “It has been well established that the government of Lebanon” has been “largely taken over, these past two decades” by Hezbollah.The letter highlighted Hezbollah’s control of the Lebanese parliament and of “every level of government and its financial system,” noting that “the current Lebanese president could not assume office until Hezbollah provided its consent.”“For all intents and purposes, the failed Lebanese state has become a puppet of Hezbollah and its patrons in Tehran,” said Darshan-Leitner.Further, Shurat Hadin said, “Hezbollah is clearly moving to control the Central Bank through its Health Ministry with the fourth largest budget in the government as well as the Communication, Agriculture, and Water ministries.”More specifically, in July 2019, the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned key Hezbollah political and security figures, including Hezbollah representative in parliament, Amin Sherri, said the NGO. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });The letter said that Hezbollah also manipulates the Lebanese banking system, including currency exchange houses, to sustain its global terrorist activities and has controlled an intricate worldwide money-laundering scheme since 2005.It “utilizes a significant part of the Lebanese financial sector to clean hundreds of millions of dollars generated by its Business Affairs Component (BAC), a network consisting of predicate crimes such as dealing in conflict diamonds, and trafficking narcotics and weapons,” stated Darshan-Leitner.Jammal Trust Bank was one piece of Hezbollah’s laundering system that was sanctioned by the US for its relationship with the Shi’ite terror group, and closed.Previously, the US has also taken legal action against Lebanese banks with Hezbollah and terrorist links for mega sums.For a moment, Shurat Hadin complimented the IMF for “insisting on severe financial reforms, including capital controls and a revised 2020 budget before it grants a recent Lebanese request for up to $10 billion.”However, the requested “fiscal reforms, and austerity measures, while crucial, do not address the real danger of why no IMF funds must be provided to Beirut while it remains under the control of Hezbollah,” said the letter.For example, Shurat Hadin said that the conditions do not require preventative measures “to ensure the aid reaches its intended recipients rather than redirected to Hezbollah through its web” of illegal enterprises.Rather, the IMF must demand an end “to the dangers posed by Hezbollah’s position in the Lebanese government. Hezbollah’s control of the Lebanese banking system and the Lebanese Treasury must be terminated… the IMF must personally guarantee that none” of its funds will be embezzled by Hezbollah.The letter threatens that; “The IMF is on notice that any funds it provides to Lebanon will be targeted by the victims of Hezbollah’s terrorism to enforce their court ordered judgments. Any banking institutions in Lebanon or abroad that transfers IMF funds to Hezbollah will be sued in relevant jurisdictions for aiding and abetting terrorism.”It is unclear exactly how Shurat Hadin could enforce local country court's judgments against IMF pass-through funds designated for Lebanon, but the NGO has shown a creative capacity in the past to seize pass-through funds meant for Iran or terror groups.

Despite hearing about the country every day, watching it on TV and walking over the Israeli flag in public spaces, Iranians in reality know little about Israel. I wanted to portray Israel because I wanted to show how important Persian-Israelis are to the Iranian diaspora and how they are preserving our Iranian culture abroad. I also wanted to share everything about Israel that the Islamic Republic has kept from Iranians for the past 40 years and I think portraying that will help people understand each other better,” said Rawarpoor.” THE 22-part weekly series shot in December 2019 takes viewers on a journey through various cities and historical sites in Israel such as the Baha’i gardens in Haifa and Tel-Aviv-Jaffa’s shuk hapishpeshim (flea market). While walking the streets in Tel Aviv, Rawarpoor occasionally bumps into Persian-Israelis and strikes up a conversation in Farsi.\xa0\xa0 “Having the opportunity to speak and communicate with people in my native language brings me comfort, because language isn’t just composed of words, it also provides a sense of the other person’s energy and I feel a deeper connection with them. This is especially true for Persian-Israelis who have lived in Israel for a long time and also enjoy speaking in their native language,” said Rawarpoor.

After meeting the guests inside their music shop in Tel Aviv, Rawarpoor joins Menashe and Farzaneh for Shabbat dinner. The evening includes a buffet of traditional Persian dishes and a performance by her daughter who plays the santoor.In addition to revealing how Persian-Israelis are preserving their roots, Rawarpoor’s documentary also exposes the community’s nostalgia for Iran. During his visit to Kibbutz Alumim, for example, he befriends a pair of elderly Persian-Israeli men who recount memories of their hometown in Iran and how they met. The men’s longing for Iran is common among many older Persian-Israelis, Rawarpoor relates. “One of the differences I have noticed between Iranians living in Europe and in Israel is how much Persian-Israelis miss Iran. I have never experienced anything quite like it, where I am speaking with someone in Farsi and they start to cry when I mention Iran. Most of them say they would like to visit their home country one last time before they die, even if for only a week.” In creating the documentary, he refrained from highlighting the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, because he says it is an issue that is already widely discussed and is one of many ways the Islamic regime uses propaganda to skew Iranians’ perceptions of Israel.\xa0 “I am very happy that I was able to create a documentary about Israel without taking sides. I normally don’t get into politics and wanted to highlight Israel’s culture, history and Persian-Israelis narratives and I think the less people take sides the more authentic it will be for audiences,” he said.Rawarpoor believes the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not black and white and Israel’s origins and Zionism should be evaluated from a historical perspective. “We shouldn’t say that in 1948 Israelis took over the country and ousted the Palestinians. We should instead examine Israeli’s origins from more than 100 years ago or 200 years ago to have a better understanding of the country.”THE FILMMAKER sips tea and speaks with another Persian-Israeli about his life in Iran before immigrating to Kibbutz Alumim. (Credit: Courtesy of Human David Rawarpoor/Instagram/Manoto)SINCE THE series debut, he says he has received mostly positive feedback from Persian-Israelis and Iranians living in Iran. “So many of my viewers tell me that they didn’t know so many Iranians are living in Israel and thank me for introducing them to the country and what is taking place there. I have had so many followers reach out to me on Instagram and say that this could be a way to bring people from two different countries together and promote peace.” He believes his determination to portray Israel and Persian-Israelis truthfully is what has led to the series success. “I wanted to show that 50% of Haifa’s university’s student body is Arab; I wanted to show the Iranian population in Israel and their strong affinity toward their culture; I wanted to show how Iranians are continuing to preserve their heritage by playing traditional Iranian instruments. People in Iran are unaware of this segment of the diaspora and how they are striving to maintain their roots, which is why I think we should remember that we are all part of the human race and that Israel and Iran could be close allies despite Iran’s animosity toward Israel.”Manoto is an independent London-based free-to-air Persian- and English-language general entertainment channel whose programming includes documentaries, films, news and more. Its broadcast area includes Europe, Northern Africa and the Middle East, and it is estimated that it is watched by at least a third of all households in Iran.

They also “condemned the illegal oil deal between a US-licensed company and the illegitimate entity as part of its separatist agenda.”The US has worked with the SDF since 2015. However, Turkey claims the SDF is linked to a group called the People’s Protection Units and that both are linked to the Kurdistan Workers Party. Therefore, Turkey calls them all “terrorists,” even though there is no evidence of any terrorist attacks against Turkey by the SDF.Turkey has used this as an excuse to invade Kurdish areas of Syria, ethnically cleansing Afrin in 2018 by backing Syrian rebel extremist groups. Last October, Turkey threatened US forces and ordered the Trump administration to leave Syria.Then Turkey attacked Tel Abyad, and Turkish-backed groups murdered Syrian Kurdish activists, including Hevrin Khalaf. Since then, Turkish-backed groups have kidnapped and killed numerous women, forcing Yazidis and Christians to flee. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });Now, Turkey, Iran and Russia are working closely to pressure the US. While the Trump administration wants to secure the oil in Syria and the Pentagon wants to continue to keep ISIS defeated, Ankara and its Iranian and Russian allies seek to undermine the US. Iran has agreed to take the Deir ez-Zor file and pressure the US along the Euphrates, while Turkey does the same in Tel Abyad by cutting off water to SDF-controlled areas, and Russia uses patrols to harass the US.Turkey cuts off the water at the Allouk water station and carries out drone strikes to harass areas where the SDF is present. Meanwhile, it also sends intelligence agents to try to smuggle people out of al-Hol refugee camp, where some ISIS-affiliated families live.The Iranian role in Deir ez-Zor – seeking to use tribes to undermine the SDF – was reported by Asharq al-Awsat newspaper on August 27. Iran has bases from Albu Kamal to al-Mayadeen in Syria, where its affiliates – including Shi’ites from Pakistan and local recruits – operate.It can use these to stir up trouble across the Euphrates. Russian-backed mercenaries also operated here, attacking the SDF in February 2018. A Russian officer was recently killed by ISIS on the Syrian regime’s side of the river. The entire area appears to be insecure and unstable. Iran exploits this.Slamming the US oil deal is just the latest way that Iran, Turkey and Russia seek to work together. They don’t agree on other issues in Syria. For instance, Russia and Turkey conduct joint patrols in Idlib, but Russia backs the Syrian regime, and Turkey backs Syrian rebels.Turkey has sent Syrian rebels to fight in Libya in the last six months to keep them from focusing on Syria and Turkey’s mutual work with Russia in Syria.

We are open to any calm discussion for a new political contract but on the condition it take place with agreement from all Lebanese factions," Nasrallah said in a speech.He said the movement supported "reforms to the widest extent" if there was a mechanism to agree on them. French President Emmanuel Macron, due to visit Beirut again on Monday, has outlined reforms local politicians must make to unlock foreign aid to tackle a deep financial crisis rooted in corruption and mismanagement, including an interim government capable of enacting change and early parliamentary polls.RIVALS AND FACTIONSThere has been little progress in agreeing on a premier so far amid political rivalries and factional jostling.

Israel and the US have said they are pushing more Arab countries to follow the UAE\'s path. Israel\'s Intelligence Minister Eli Cohen has mentioned Bahrain as a possible candidate."I think that UAE\'s decision creates a climate that makes it easier for another country to follow, and more countries after that," the state department official on the tour said.Bahrain welcomed the UAE-Israel accord soon after it was announced and said it raised the chances of peace.The small island state of Bahrain houses the US Navy\'s Fifth Fleet, the US Naval Forces Central Command (USNAVCENT) and a British naval support facility. The International Maritime Security Construct (IMSC), formed in 2019 to protect commercial shipping in the Gulf after a series of tanker attacks, is also based in Bahrain.Khalifa said he welcomed US efforts towards the Israel-UAE accord, noting "the importance of re-doubling efforts to realize a just solution which utilizes peace as a strategic option to end the Palestinian-Israeli conflict," state news agency BNA said.PLO Executive Committee Secretary-General Saeb Erekat tweeted in appreciation of Bahrain’s comments during their meeting with Pompeo in support of making peace between Israel and the Palestinians first, before normalizing ties with the Arab world. It also held to the idea of a two-state solution at the pre-1967 lines with east Jerusalem as its capital. The Trump administration peace plan does not hold by the pre-1967 lines. “We highly appreciate the position of H.M. King Hamad Bin Issa Al Khalifa of Bahrain. We hope that mr.

The US handed over facilities to the Iraqis on August 23. Iran celebrated this on Saturday with the article about the handover.The article highlighted Brig.-Gen. Tahseen Khafaji, spokesman for the Iraqi Joint Operations Command. The article was also designed to prevent rumors that other countries besides the US were present. This was a big base for the US and anti-ISIS coalition and some 2,000 personnel were at the base.Now the US says one third of the troops in Iraq will leave, according to The Wall Street Journal. Since the US had 5,000 personnel in Iraq, clearly the closure of Taji will reduce that force, even if some are re-positioned to friendlier areas, such as the Kurdistan Region.Rumors in Iraq said that despite the US’s departure, Saudi Arabia had troops at Taji. This is part of rumors designed to undermine Iraq-Saudi relations as Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi wants to work with Saudi Arabia. Kadhimi met the Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan, on August 28. Pro-Iran groups in Iraq opposed the meeting.Tahseen has denied the rumors that Saudis are at Taji. Only Iraqis are present, he said. “Non-Iraqi forces are not at the base and the media should be more careful reporting the news,” he indicated, reports say. Taji is 80\xa0km. north of Baghdad. Tens of thousands of Iraqis were trained there by the coalition over the years. Iranian media says that the US left Taji because it was afraid of more attacks. The US says it was a planned handover.

It is the story of individuals from various backgrounds who, one by one, came to Dubai or Abu Dhabi and formed a community that played an important role in the developing deal.Some of its first members were Sharon and Simon Eder, Ranna and Giacomo Arazi and Michael and Martine Nates, all coming in about 2008. There certainly were others, but they apparently had remained under the radar.The UAE is located on the Gulf at the northeastern end of the Arabian Peninsula, bordering Oman to the east and Saudi Arabia to the south and west. As the name implies, it is a federation of seven political territories, each independently governed by its own emir.The Emirate of Abu Dhabi, which serves as the capital, is joined by Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah, Ras Al Khaimah, Sharjah and Umm Al Quwain. (Qatar and Kuwait, although emirates, are not part of the UAE.)The seven entities are represented in the world community by their highest constitutional authority, the Federal Supreme Council.Its president is one of the seven rulers. The current president is Abu Dhabi’s crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, ruler of the Emirate of Dubai, is vice president and prime minister of the UAE. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });The largest population among the Emirates is in Dubai, with some 3.3 million people. Abu Dhabi’s population stands at 1.5 million.Sharon and Simon EderAmong the first known Jews to reside in Dubai in the 21st century were Sharon and Simon Eder, both born and raised in the United Kingdom.Sharon’s mother was from Libya and her father from Iraq. Simon’s parents, both of Ashkenazi descent, grew up with strong Jewish identities. Sharon attended Hebrew school and Simon observed the Sabbath.“Shock and negative reaction” is how Sharon describes the response by friends and family to the Eders’ decision to move to an Arab country, where Simon was offered a job in the conference industry.“We were absolutely the first. I’m sure there were Jews there, but they didn’t really congregate,” Sharon tells The Media Line.“Prior to leaving London, we received three different phone numbers [of couples known to be moving to Dubai]. Then we realized the three numbers were the same, and all belonged to Ranna and Jack Arazi, who also moved from the UK around the same time.”Upon their arrival in the Gulf, the two families connected and began sharing traditional Friday night Shabbat dinners. The discussions always turned to the idea that there must be other Jews living there, too.“We always spoke like the TV series Lost – there must be another part of the island,” Sharon says. “My husband would say randomly, ‘That person looks Jewish,’ and often we would get it wrong.”Finally, a good friend of the Eders’ from London introduced them to another Jewish couple while they were slowly meeting others by chance. That was the starting point of the community.“In 2009, I fell pregnant, and that played a big part for Simon and me. We’re really happy here; we both had strong Jewish identities; how long can this go on?” she recalls thinking at the time.“At the time I got pregnant, I was traveling all over the world for my job, working for Bacardi, heading up the region from a local office in Dubai,” she relates.“I was five months pregnant [in 2010] and we decided to fly to Sri Lanka for Passover. As chance would have it, we went to Chabad and the rabbi said, ‘This is crazy, I never knew anybody from Dubai,’ but [the previous day] a man [had come] to him from Abu Dhabi,” she says. Sharon explains to The Media Line that the man had been in the Middle East for decades. He was the head of an institution in Abu Dhabi and spoke 12 languages flawlessly.“We decided to call him up,” she says.“At that point, I was due in August,” she continues, “and we basically would stay in Dubai for the holidays and try to get a rabbi to come. He knew other Jews and enabled [them to practice their Judaism]. We sent out emails and asked if anyone was interested in getting a rabbi for the holidays.”They contacted the Chabad rabbi in Sri Lanka, who came for Yom Kippur, staying a week.“It was held in an apartment and was a big success, with 35 people attending,” she says. “After that, Sabbath dinners were held in different homes. There was a lot of excitement because either people had been practicing in secret for many years or hadn’t practiced for many years in the Arab nation.”Sharon notes that the community was so diverse that “if we got together, the traditions followed were based on the host family.”They were meeting people, Jew by Jew.The Eders had two children born in Dubai and had to fly in a mohel to perform the ritual circumcision. Ironically, the night before the brit mila ceremony, they received a call from a Jewish person living in Lebanon who also needed a mohel. A day later, the couple and their child flew into Dubai for their own circumcision ceremony.Sharon shares another story of Jew-connecting-to-Jew.“My German obstetrician said he had a Jewish patient ‘who tells me she is German, but I think she is 100% Jewish,’” she says.“Her name was Inbal. I said to my doctor it was an Israeli name and to tell her it means ‘inside of a bell [clapper],’” she relates.“Quite surprised, Inbal finally gave in to the German doctor, who introduced us. The morning of the evening of Yom Kippur, I called [her] and said these are the details, and please join us if you want,” she goes on.“Inbal was shocked. She was driving on [a highway] and almost had an accident,” she says. “She came in while her German husband stayed in the car outside – he thought it was a set-up.”Sharon remembers being heavily pregnant as she and Simon were shopping alongside a man also loading up on baby items. As they left the shop, Simon said to Sharon, “He’s 100% Jewish,” to which Sharon said: “Not again, the last one ended up being Iranian.”Simon quickly introduced himself.“The guy was from New York,” Sharon says, with nothing being mentioned about religion.Six months later, they received an email from the man.“I don’t know if you remember me but from the moment I met you, I couldn’t stop thinking you were Jewish but didn’t have the courage to ask,” he wrote.The man added that he had been practicing his Judaism privately and finally had become so upset about it that he did a deep Google search. The next Friday night, he was sitting at Sharon and Simon’s Shabbat table for dinner.Sharon tells The Media Line that in the early days, the Jews living there were nervous about organizing, and nothing in the way of Jewish groups was established.“It grew organically,” she explains.The Eders moved back to London in 2013 and had their third child there.“We were very much there at the beginning and the first ones to step out on the ice,” she says. “By the time we left, we had well-established traditions. We celebrated Jewish holidays, the Sabbath, even Hanukkah, camping in the desert. We brought the community to the next level.”Ranna and Giacomo Arazi“Giacomo [Jack] was [approached] for a job in finance in Dubai. Of course, I was hesitant at the beginning – knowing that no community or Jewish life existed there did make it a bit daunting,” Ranna Arazi tells The Media Line.“With a background in communications and media, and Jack’s in economics, in the first few years we started our own multi-brand exhibitions company for luxury motor shows and property exhibitions held in malls and international financial centers,” she states.Giacomo was born and raised in Italy. His mother was from Lebanon, his father from Syria. Ranna’s parents were both born in Tehran.“It was like one big holiday in the beginning,” she notes. “I had friends from the UAE through travel, and other friends. The Emiratis are well educated and worldly.”The Arazis were introduced to the Eders via mutual friends from the UK. They decided to get together regularly, and also wondered if there were other Jews living in Dubai.“We seemed to be like a magnet. People would call us up and say they were traveling through Dubai, were religious, and could they come for dinner,” Ranna says.“The Jewish community grew organically. We had nothing, no prayer books. Our prayers were all on iPads. But there must have been Jews in the UAE for many years prior and I presume they didn’t feel safe enough to come together. … It wasn’t something we were planning on making public at all,” she recalls.“We lived in a very large villa, hosting all the large festivals, and would invite Jewish people in the community and travelers. The Eders, and Jack and I, were the pillar-founding families, then others joined in. Sixty to 70 people were at our Seder table,” Ranna says.“Ross and Elli Kriel came for one of the holidays, and Ross, being a religious man, was interested in an Orthodox … minyan [where a quorum of 10 is required for public prayer]. However, we would all partake in [the] host’s home and respect each other’s religious observance,” she states.The Arazis have a son, Marco, and a daughter, Sara, who was born in 2009 in Dubai – although she could not obtain UAE nationality or a passport. Nationality is conferred only by blood or through marriage.“Marco was turning 12 and it was really important for us – and especially for Jack and his family – that he have a proper bar mitzvah,” Ranna says.“We didn’t want to bring up two teens in an Arab country,” she goes on. “I left Dubai a few months earlier than Jack, back to London, and Ross asked Jack if [he and Elli] could use our villa for the holidays, and then if they could kosher the kitchen. We introduced them to the landlord, and that is how our home became ‘The Villa’ in Dubai.”Elli and Ross KrielA mixture of South African and Greek, Elli Kriel was raised on the east coast of South Africa, near the city of Durban. Husband Ross grew up in Johannesburg in a completely secular home.“My grandfather was an enlightenment Jew,” Ross, an in-house lawyer for ENGIE, an energy company, tells The Media Line. “I turned 18 and realized I didn’t have a Jewish identity. It bothered me. Now, 30 years later, I am an Orthodox Jew living in Dubai.”Elli and Ross are a dynamic couple who anchor the Jewish community. When they arrived in 2013, they were the only religiously observant Jewish family in the area.“We were completely on our own: no rabbi, no synagogue, no parents as influencers. It generated the most exciting version of Judaism,” he reflects.“Thirty or 40 Jews lived in the community. We built it up brick-by-brick and created the Jewish Council of the Emirates,” he says.There is no resident rabbi. When a baby boy is born, the child’s family flies in a mohel to perform the circumcision.“The minyan began in my lounge, and then I leased The Villa on behalf of the Jewish Council of the Emirates in 2015,” he explains.The Villa serves as a community center, the Kriels the community backbone.“I have been the de facto leader of the community for many years, and the community has been gathering since 2010,” Ross says.Formally established in 2019, the Jewish Council of the Emirates is the umbrella body for all of the area’s Jewish communities, as well as the official link to government.The Kriel children were born in South Africa and came to Dubai when they were three and four years old, respectively. Today, they are among 90 children in the first through the seventh grades and attend the International School.Synagogue attendance has been suspended because of the coronavirus pandemic, but plans are in formation for a larger place of worship.Ross explains that while the Jewish community has remained below the general public’s radar, it is well known to Emirati officials.“We made every effort to communicate our presence and were received with a warm welcome,” he states. “Here we discovered our Judaism. Our amazing story is about our ability to rise to the circumstances. … Our presence here [is] the beginning of something hopeful about the way Jews, Muslims and Christians can work together.”Elli’s Kosher KitchenFor travel to Dubai as a kosher Jew when Elli and Ross began their journey, a wide range of basic staples including flour, oil and tuna were available. But, according to Elli, “there was nothing anyone could eat.”Elli, who holds a doctorate in the sociology of religions and ironically studied exclusion and inclusion in multicultural contexts, began a takeout establishment from her home, offering full, hearty meals to local Jews and visitors. She would feed many of her customers in her home, eventually sending food packages to more than 400 travelers listed in her database.“I’m self-taught,” she tells The Media Line, “and learned my love of cooking from my grandmother. I have all of her hand-written recipes. I was also influenced by my community in South Africa, and a lot of women share their recipes with me regularly.”Elli sees the Jewish community in South Africa and how social change impacted on the experience as an example of the thesis she wrote for her doctorate. She explains that identity and belonging are key underlying themes.“My life in Dubai seems to be an extension of these ideas,” she says proudly.When the UAE hosted the Interfaith Global Conference for Human Fraternity, attended by Pope Francis, Elli catered for the Jewish delegates. Weeks later, her business was launched. From babkas and Grandma’s matzah ball soup to zatar-and-olive challah and aubergine borekas, her offerings are loved by Emiratis.Elli was featured recently in the National, a Gulf newspaper, where she describes her food fare as “kosherati” – kosher cooking with an Emirati twist.Elli’s Kitchen has plans to expand and establish a restaurant that will be able to handle incoming tourists and local trade. She is also looking forward to importing kosher food products to the Emirates.Alex Peterfreund“I saw an opportunity to move but was very concerned that, because of my religious background, I was moving not only to a physical desert but to a spiritual one and would find myself in a little room eating a traditional gefilte fish for Shabbat,” Alex Peterfreund tells The Media Line.A 54-year-old divorcee and businessman who is originally from Antwerp and works in the diamond industry, Alex instead found himself sharing his first Friday night dinner with the Kriels at their home, not having known that a fellow Orthodox Jew lived in Dubai.During the meal, Ross asked Alex about his plans for the next morning. When Alex replied “I’m praying in my home in the morning,” Ross responded by suggesting: “If you’re praying in your home and I in mine, why shouldn’t we pray together?”It became a practice.“Every Sabbath morning, we prayed as though we were 200 people praying with the Torah,” Alex says. “Eventually, a third Jewish guy from Canada of Moroccan descent came, and then a fourth – his father taught in a French school when he was a child – and suddenly a miracle happened. We had a minyan.”The community has since outgrown The Villa and is seeking funding to establish a cultural, religious and business center where all denominations can pray and gather.“We see the center as the Jewish business card of the Emirates,” he states.When asked about a Jewish cemetery, he says there is none – “but it’s an interesting question!”London’s Marble Arch Synagogue donated the Orthodox community’s first Torah, the handwritten scroll of the Five Books of Moses.“Today we are a community of somewhere between 200 and 300 people, and on the Sabbath, maybe 30. The community is made up of people from many professions, including lawyers, doctors, businessmen and people in media,” he explains.“We as Jews have always been discreet in the UAE, and people listen to the rules of this country and to the authority,” Alex says.“We pray for the rulers of Dubai and Abu Dhabi, just as Jews do in England, Paris or New York for their home country of residence,” he proudly tells The Media Line.Beth Margolis Rupp: Leading the Way in Abu Dhabi“In 2008, my husband, David, our children and I visited Abu Dhabi for the first time to determine if we could live there and feel safe as a Jewish family, to live and learn about the Gulf region, and to give our youngest son a chance to learn about the region. But the 2008 economic downturn was a challenge for architects,” Beth Margolis Rupp tells The Media Line, referring to her husband’s profession.Beth had worked in Jewish education in the previous decades and was founding director of the Satell Teen Fellowship for Leadership and Social Activism. She designed and implemented numerous programs on conservation, environmental and social justice for Philadelphia youth both in the United States and in Israel. She also taught about the universal lessons of the Holocaust.“I did all this with both Jewish and secular lenses in America,” she says.It was an easy transition for Beth to work remotely for Satell, so in 2009, they made the move with their youngest child after a second scouting trip.“Our child was seven years old then and went to Jewish preschool and synagogue in Philadelphia while our older children were in college. How do you tell your child to keep religion private without shame?” she says. “When we first moved to the UAE, it was a time when Jewish people were not revealing their identity. We sought out the Jewish community.”Professionally, husband David became project director for award-winning buildings, including The Gate, The Sun and Sky Tower, and eventually the Louvre Abu Dhabi.“I was still working in the US remotely as director of the Satell Fellowship…, then got a job with New York University and subsequently worked at the American Community School in Abu Dhabi, where my son attended. I was also a research associate for the Institute for International Security at Khalifa University,” she notes.“Before connecting with many Jewish families in Abu Dhabi, we traveled to Cairo for our first Passover in the [region]. We needed a place to keep [the] Passover [laws and rituals],” Beth says. “Abu Dhabi was still somewhat lonely for us that first year. Our son asked the Four Questions at a Seder [the Passover ritual meal] in Cairo.”In 2009, when NYU President John Sexton announced that a university campus would be hosted in Abu Dhabi, he invited the school’s Jewish chaplain, Rabbi Yehuda Sarna, to join him in interviewing young high school students seeking admission, albeit without revealing Sarna’s Jewish identity.Starting in 2010, the rabbi began traveling to the UAE “once or twice a year.” In 2019, he became the UAE’s first chief rabbi.Traveling to the UAE “roughly every other month” since taking up the post, he tells The Media Line he “had no idea” that the Abraham Accord was going to happen. He now predicts that the UAE will have “several full time rabbis” in the coming years.Beth wrote to Sarna to learn how Jewish faculty and students would observe Jewish life while living in the Gulf, and requested a meeting upon his visit to the Gulf. They met when he accompanied Sexton on one of his visits.Meanwhile, she wanted to find other Jews in the Emirates.“As we met people, we invited them for Shabbat. We met Sharon and Simon, and through them, Elli and Ross. We collected people and families over time. We met Jewish people from around the globe,” she explains.“We created a Jewish women’s group, and several times the women would come to Abu Dhabi to see… our way of life. AJC [the American Jewish Committee] sent a group of young Jewish college women to Ziad University, and I took them around and gave them an understanding of life in Dubai,” she relates.Educating their son in Judaism was important to the Rupps.“We had a mezuzah,” she says, referring to a religious scroll attached to the outside of a home’s doorpost, where it is seen by passers-by. “But it was on the inside of the door.”She recalls that on one Rosh Hashana, her son took apples and honey to school. Dipping slices of apple in honey is a traditional way people wish one another a sweet year during the holiday.“Another boy noticed it and asked if he, too, had eaten it at home [the previous] night. They became friends, and years later studied for their bar mitzvas together,” she says.At the same time that Beth was home-schooling her son in Jewish studies, a Jewish woman was offering instruction in Hebrew.Prof. Joel Bernstein was recruited early on by NYU to teach chemistry in Abu Dhabi. His life partner, Tzipi Springer-Eynot, was an Israeli born in Kazakhstan who had landed in Israel by way of a post-war German DP camp. She went with him on their scouting trip.“On the flight, I noticed Israel was not part of the map of the Middle East and I told Joel I don’t want to go to place which doesn’t recognize Israel as a country,” Tzipi tells The Media Line. “When we arrived, we met staff and were taken for a tour. I [nevertheless] found the place intriguing and unique.”Having a background in teaching, Tzipi was asked to provide instruction for a student from Hungary who wanted to continue his studies of the Hebrew language. Suddenly, there were 15 students from around the world, including Yemen, Jordan and Morocco, who wanted to learn Hebrew.“I taught them bi-weekly,” she says. “They had a willingness to learn, and curiosity. I taught them about the Jewish holidays as well.”The ‘tale of the wandering Jew’ and the need for Jews to find one another is illustrated by Beth Margolis Rupp’s anecdotes of the people who have traveled through, and those who have sought each other out. It turns out that she, too, was a player who was being noticed without her knowing it.“I was honored to be invited to the home of Sheikh Nayhan bin Mubarak Al Nayhan, the minister of culture, youth and social development, to his Eid majilas – events in the homes of the leadership in the country where they make themselves accessible and converse on various topics, offering the sheikhs the opportunity to hear from the people,” she relates. “I was with the sheikh for a few minutes, and then escorted back to the women’s section for dinner.”Meanwhile, Beth’s work at NYU was in researching NGOs, governmental institutions and religious institutions and the way they were meeting the needs of societies.“I saw the religious institutions providing comfort and resources to [the] people,” she states. “I spent time speaking to imams, with various churches, and went to Hindu temples.”Beth describes as “unnerving” a telephone call she received from Rev. Andrew Thompson, head of Abu Dhabi’s St. Andrews Anglican Church, who was seeking out someone who knew what was going on in the city’s Jewish community. Not surprisingly, though, after several meetings, the reverend became an invited guest at the Rupp’s Shabbat table.“It takes three cups of coffee to become friends with someone, and that’s the way it was in Abu Dhabi,” Beth says.In 2013, Rev. Thompson convened a meeting of religious leaders in the home of the deputy chief of mission at the United States Embassy, Ethan A. Goldrich.Representatives showed up to talk about their community, and the concept of a book on tolerance evolved. The reverend knew the crown prince, sheikhs and government officials, and he brought the concept to them. Several years later it became Celebrating Tolerance.The Rupps left the UAE to be with Beth’s dad, who was getting on in years.“I helped build an amazing, vibrant Jewish community,” she says. “It was rich, not one denomination – not only Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, Reconstructionist or secular. I also realize how grateful I am to Ross [Kriel] and the Orthodox Jewish community, and the deep importance of the need to have a minyan. These people held the principles of Jewish life together and created the opportunities for everybody to be there.”Would she go back?“I’d move back,” she says, “in a heartbeat.”Jean CandiotteBorn and raised in Bethpage, New York, a writer and producer of video content for multimedia platforms, Jean Candiotte told her lawyer husband Barry Greenberg one snowy January morning in 2014 that she had a chance to do a Skype call for a job in Dubai. Barry, too, was seeking his next big gig.Jean had been working with multinational entertainment companies, including News Corp, Viacom and NBC Universal. This was an opportunity to be a creative director for OSN, a Dubai-based direct-broadcast company.“I interviewed in January, signed a contract in February, and two months later, we were in Dubai. The flight was on a Friday, we arrived on Saturday, and I began working on Sunday,” she tells The Media Line.“On Monday night, my husband Barry and I were partaking of a communal Passover meal, the Seder. Elli and Ross [Kriel] and other community members were at one of two Seders,” she relates.Jean’s mother was raised Orthodox, and her father, if asked, would state “I’m Sephardi!” The family attended a Conservative synagogue, where Jean had a bat mitzvah. Barry had less of a Jewish experience growing up.Jean notes that “many of us arrived in Dubai not wanting to make our Jewish identity known” to the wider public.“For me it started changing during the past year or so because of the Year of Tolerance, which the UAE government announced in 2019, and [because Crown Prince] Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed announced plans for the Abrahamic Family house, which would be a multi-faith campus and educational center consisting of a mosque, a church and a synagogue,” she explains. “The UAE is proving how progressive they have been in this area.”In 2016, Beth Margolis Rupp, together with Jean and Ross Kriel, were asked to write and edit the chapter dedicated to the UAE’s Jewish community in Celebrating Tolerance, which by this time had been commissioned by a government ministry.“Our story of ‘coming out’ and being accepted was [in a] chapter celebrating 12 minority religious communities in the UAE,” she says. “It was published in 2019, and a copy was given to Pope Francis during his visit to the UAE – his first to a Gulf country – when he signed the Document of Fraternity.”Jean notes that a quote in the chapter “expresses [their] sentiment.” It says: “We are neighbors here, and if you look back, you’ll see that we are actually each other’s family from long ago. You may see us wearing our Hand of Miriam as you wear the Hand of Fatima. We are grateful for our lives here, for the opportunity to be recognized by the UAE government, and for being able to share our story.”Jean says: “We felt acknowledged in a wonderful way. It acknowledged our community and I felt great about living in a community doing so much about tolerance.”In March 2020, she was asked to speak to the European Parliament in Brussels as part of a conference about tolerance. Rev. Thompson was one of several speakers. The keynote speaker was H.E. Dr. Ali Rashid Al Nuaimi, chairman of Hedayah, the International Center of Excellence for Countering Violent Extremism, and a member of the UAE Federal National Council based in Abu Dhabi. He traveled from Abu Dhabi to attend along with his staff.“These points got us over the mountain to the place we are today,” she states.“It’s been personal growth that has kept me here, and for my husband a great career opportunity,” Jean says. “The overall experience in the UAE has been exciting, and made us want to stay.”Rebecca and YoniAustralia-raised Rebecca – who prefers to keep her family name private – was born in Botswana to Israeli parents, who then moved to New Zealand and finally Australia, where she spent her adolescent years.Rebecca moved back to Dubai a second time because of a job opportunity. She also missed life in the Middle East.The family of her husband, Yoni, had moved to Singapore from Israel. Yoni’s father was born in pre-state Israel. His mother came from an Orthodox family. Yoni himself was raised on Kibbutz Bror Hayil near Ashkelon, founded by Egyptian Jews.Rebecca is Sephardi on her Tunisian mother’s side and Ashkenazi on her Polish father’s side. Her dad grew up attending synagogue but the family was not fully observant.Yoni and Rebecca met in Australia, where they were married in a civil ceremony. Three months after arriving in Dubai in 2012, they traveled through Jordan to Israel, where they underwent an additional ceremony.During their first time living in the UAE, Yoni was hired as a design researcher for NYU Abu Dhabi, and Rebecca, a trained psychologist, worked at a well-known clinic in Dubai. There was no formal Jewish community then, but according to Rebecca, NYU’s chaplain, Rabbi Sarna, “directed us to the blossoming Jewish community in Dubai, where we would come and spend Shabbat with Elli and Ross [Kriel], and often stay with them.”As the community began to establish itself, the couple left to raise their two children in Australia. But missing the Dubai clinic, which in the interim had grown, Rebecca was anxious to return, which the family did in 2019. Yoni is now head of design for an online real estate portal.Raising their young daughters in the UAE, they spend a lot of time with the Kriel Family, among others, celebrating Shabbat and holidays.“Online Jewish lessons, as well as online Shabbat services because of COVID-19, maintain our Jewish identity,” Rebecca tells The Media Line.“The government here has been working hard with Ross [Kriel] to establish a place of Jewish worship. The community development authority has to issue a license for the Jewish community to have its space and to be able to practice, as it does for any denomination, be it churches or temples,” she states.Breakaway SynagogueAn old Jewish joke says that when a synagogue reaches its 11th man – one beyond the quorum for public prayer – a second synagogue is born. Rabbi Levi Duchman, who is associated with the Chabad movement (which is not officially recognized by the UAE government), recently established a second synagogue in the Emirates.Duchman, according to members of the Jewish community, had been attending the Orthodox minyan for the previous five years. He appointed Solly Wolf, who attended services during High Holy Days, as president. The synagogue does not call itself Chabad.Jewish Businessmen, Rabbis and Former Government OfficialsJewish businessmen have been trailblazers in opening the nexus between the United States and Dubai, as well as Israel.Eli Epstein of Westchester, New York, began flying to Dubai 30 years ago for business as CEO of a large petroleum by-product company. During the years, he would bring rabbis and introduce top members of the American Jewish Committee to government officials.“I was helping the AJC with introductions in the UAE, and the Jewish community was beginning to organize a Shabbat gathering in local hotels,” he tells The Media Line.Epstein played a significant role as a conduit to some leading Emirati businesspeople, including Mohamed Alabbar, the impressive entrepreneur who built the Burj Khalifa skyscraper. He dedicated a Torah scroll for the community in honor of Alabbar, who witnessed the ceremony.“The Torah has an Arabic dedication on the front acknowledging Mohamed’s leadership and the inspiration he offered to his generation,” Epstein says. “He spoke to the community on a Friday night and stayed for dinner. Mohamed played a key role for many I introduced him to.”In addition to the scroll from London’s Marble Arch Synagogue, there is a third, this one from Temple Brith Shalom in Erie, Pennsylvania.Epstein is considered a trailblazer.“I didn’t know I was this,” he says, referring to the description.“Over the years I became someone trusted, which enabled me to bring rabbis,” he states. “Over time, the Emirates realized that not all Jews are Israelis. I was early in the game. I didn’t sign up as a trailblazer. Frankly, I am changed. My worldview changed and I even pray differently because of Islam.”Describing Epstein’s role from the perspective of the UAE’s Jewish community, Jean Candiotte tells The Media Line: “Eli is the poster child for being active in business and interactive in government, and therefore one of those people who help create the friendship between the UAE and the Jewish community.”Looking ahead, Epstein says: “We’re heading into the blue yonder. It’s a watershed for Israel and the region, a harbinger of strategic realignment of the Middle East. Two years from now, we’ll look back, amazed at what happened. No one can count on America; in the Middle East, you are your own first responder.”There have been many others who have frequented the UAE, working to open a dialogue among faiths and achieve recognition for the Jewish community on the Arabian Peninsula. They include Rabbi David Rosen, the AJC’s international director of religious affairs; Rabbi Y. Dov Krakowski of the Orthodox Union; Rabbi Dov Goldstein; Stephen M. Greenberg and Malcolm Hoenlein of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations; Rabbi Marc Schneier, president of the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding; and Rabbi Michael Schudrich, the chief rabbi of Poland. In addition, Rabbis Marvin Heir and Abraham Cooper of the Simon Wiesenthal Center have spent considerable time engaging the Emirates.“The early Simon Wiesenthal Center missions to the UAE were real eye-openers. We had the opportunity to meet with a young dynamic Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, and with open-minded business leaders like Mohamed Alabbar, who revealed to us a place where our faith and our people were not merely tolerated, but respected,” Rabbi Cooper, associate dean and director of the Global Social Action Agenda for the Wiesenthal Center, tells The Media Line.“It cannot be lost on anyone that all this takes place in the UAE as the last Jews of Yemen are hounded out of homes they have lived in for over a thousand years,” Cooper adds. “Only a fanatic Jew-hater like the Ayatollah Khamenei, who backs the Houthis [in Yemen], can be celebrating that an Arab nation is about to become Judenrein. Contrast this as the ruler of Abu Dhabi, His Majesty, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, as well as Dubai’s Sheikh Mohamed, pave the way for more Jewish people to come to Dubai.”Under the radarAlthough news of ongoing contacts between officials from Israel and the UAE continue to surface, many visits by Israelis have been, and will continue to be, under the radar. These include government figures, Mossad agents, executives from defense and security companies as well as other strategic partnerships.In 2018, then-minister of sport Miri Regev escorted Israel’s national team to the International Judo Federation Grand Slam in Abu Dhabi. The current director of the Mossad, Yossi Cohen, made a high-profile visit to the UAE after many clandestine meetings in the Gulf region, which cemented the recent deal toward normalization.In 2001, Dr. Efraim Sneh, a cabinet minister and retired brigadier general, traveled secretly to Dubai.“I was in the inner cabinet of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and went to the UAE for the purpose of establishing relations, and had very high-level meetings,” Sneh reveals to The Media Line. “Since then, I have been advocating between Israel and the Gulf countries, and have been there many times in the past year acting to cement relations between Israel and the UAE.”On waking up to the Abraham AccordRoss Kriel: “I thought many steps would be taken until we had full diplomatic recognition. People could see where it was going, so quickly as well. We hope that this is just the beginning and will invigorate completely new paradigms for people in the Middle East, one that is based on the ability to make change and move forward. … Five years ahead, Emirates and Israelis are so open to this. I’m hoping it produces better stability and economic growth.”Elli Kriel: “It’s an amazing turn of events. I was shocked, quite honestly, and thought the deal was coming in one year’s time. I thought things would open up for the Expo, but not this soon. We received a barrage of responses and it changed things here, too. It allows us to be public without any reservations. Before we had to be careful. … My daughter sang the UAE’s national anthem in Arabic, and it went viral. … This paves the way for positive and constructive development, setting an example how many cultures can live together in one small place. I do hope it will be received positively around the world.”Alex Peterfreund: “At 3 in the morning, when the news broke, I couldn’t sleep. I was chatting with Ross on WhatsApp thinking that in 10 years, there may be 20,000 Jews living in Dubai and we will be sitting in the back of the synagogue remembering those times when we prayed together. If you told me this deal was happening, I’d tell you science fiction is on the second floor.”Jean Candiotte: “I read it on my WhatsApp in disbelief; I felt I was in a dream. It is a great movement toward peace. We felt we had planted the seeds and it was growing, but I didn’t think I’d see it during my time living in the UAE.”Rebecca: “I felt it was coming. I have a lot of Emirati friends and clients [who are] well established in the community and hear a change in business and political points of view. I hear of the US soldiers coming here who were trained in Israel, and the sharing of knowledge. I think it’s the best news we could have possibly gotten. I happen to live here and have a great deal of respect for the leaders of this country, who decided with full knowledge that it might not be the most popular or expected decision, and it might cause different types of political friction with Arab countries that deal with the UAE moving forward. … I think it is amazing for locals here to get to know Israelis who want to see the world and explore. … I see more initial exploration, but with normalization, a lot more for business endeavors.”Sharon Eder: “I knew it was bubbling. I had relationships with Israelis who were trying to make that happen and wasn’t surprised. I think it’s great. What we had for these five years that helped make it happen was special for us. It gave us an identity.”Giacomo Arazi: I have always said a full Jewish community can only happen [together] with peace with Israel. And I think it’s an exciting time for the Jewish community of Dubai. It’s an exciting place to be, that looks to the future. So does Israel; so do the Jews. I’m very optimistic.”Beth Margolis Rupp: “I wish I [had been] in Dubai with the community for the announcement of the deal. I felt so proud of the community… on the ground.”Rabbi Yehuda Sarna: “I am predicting that we will see a burst of intellectual creativity in terms of cross-continent education between the US and the UAE, and Jewish/Arab relations and studies.”EpilogueIt’s nearing the first Sabbath in Dubai since the agreement to normalize relations was announced at the White House, and Omer Yankelevich, Israel’s minister of Diaspora affairs, Zooms into the community to teleconference an emotional greeting. (Her greeting follows congratulations delivered to the community by Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu on the evening of the accord.)Ross Kriel takes extreme pride in the moment, graciously thanking all the Jews who came before him and who are there now, and all of the Jewish organizations and individuals who helped make the day possible.“There were other Jews in the UAE, perhaps each one thinking, ‘I’m the only one.’” Jean Candiotte says.Sharon Eder sees herself as something of a diplomat.“We had Arab neighbors who never met Jews before, and had an impact on them,” she says.The Jewish community of Dubai is clearly in transformation. It is opening a synagogue and kosher restaurant and is waiting with open arms to service businesspeople and tourists. The UAE has broken the glass ceiling in the Middle East, and this could not have happened without the Jews who reside there.“Jews came from all over … for two main reasons: work and safety,” Rabbi Sarna tells The Media Line.“It might sound ironic to some people that Jews feel safer in the UAE than they do in places in Europe or North America, but consider the rising antisemitism in those countries, excused in part by some prominent political voices,” he says. “Then come to the UAE and see the Year of Tolerance and the announcement of the Abrahamic Family House.”Alex Peterfreund says that for every Emirati going to Israel, there will be 200 Israelis coming to the UAE. He hopes the Emirati Jewish community can play a role in educating these travelers about the local culture and assist them with their needs, be it a place to pray or kosher food, Elli-style.Expo 2020 will be delayed until next year and will house a large Israeli pavilion – not the one Israel planned to open prior to the Abraham Accord.Jean sums it up.“I feel like it’s a great step forward toward peace and understanding,” she states. “It’s a moment of hope and optimism when most of the headlines are not feeding hope and optimism.”EDITOR’S NOTE: The author expresses her deep respect and appreciation to all who participated in the making of this article.

Significant progress was expected on the issue in the coming weeks, a senior Sudanese government source told Reuters last week.Ambassador to the US Ron Dermer said he is working behind the scenes on more Israeli peace agreements with Arab countries.“Doing this behind the scenes is very important,” he told Dubai-based Al Arabiya news channel.“There are several countries where there are possibilities [for peace],” Dermer said. “I don’t want to say this specific country or not. But there are several countries, and we hope that we see another breakthrough very, very, soon in the weeks and months ahead.”Also Sunday, White House Special Adviser Jared Kushner said the peace agreement between Israel and the UAE increased the chances that the latter would be able to buy F-35 stealth jets from the US.Netanyahu opposes such a sale to any other country in the Middle East, citing Israel’s qualitative military edge (QME). But talk of the UAE being able to buy F-35s has raised questions as to whether the prime minister knew it would happen soon after normalization, despite his protestations.“The UAE has wanted F-35s for a long time,” Kushner told CNN. “The group that wants them not to get it the most is obviously Iran… and the reality is that this new peace agreement should increase the probability of them getting it.“The UAE is a tremendous military partner for America for many years,” he said, adding that selling F-35s is “something we could see potentially happening now as a result of this great breakthrough.”The matter is under review in the US State Department and military, Kushner said, and “obviously we’ll look at the QME and do everything in accordance with the right standards.” "}, {'id': '4541d0aa-ec25-11ea-8093-fdd8c08b34d7', '__typename': 'Article', 'createdAt': '2020-09-01T07:32:20.810Z', 'updatedAt': '2020-09-01T07:32:20.810Z', 'mercuryObj': {'title': 'In pictures: History made with flight from Tel Aviv to Abu Dhabi', 'author': None, 'date_published': None, 'dek': None, 'lead_image_url': 'https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/t_JD_ArticleMainImageFaceDetect/462884', 'next_page_url': None, 'url': 'https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/in-pictures-history-made-with-flight-from-tel-aviv-to-abu-dhabi-640588', 'domain': 'www.jpost.com', 'excerpt': 'Pictures from the historic first flight between Israel and the United Arab Emirates on August 31, 2020.', 'word_count': 409, 'direction': 'ltr', 'total_pages': 1, 'rendered_pages': 1, 'source': 'www.jpost.com'}, 'url': 'https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/in-pictures-history-made-with-flight-from-tel-aviv-to-abu-dhabi-640588', 'category': 'armiger', 'subcategory': None, 'absSum': None, 'title': 'In pictures: History made with flight from Tel Aviv to Abu Dhabi', 'source': 'www.jpost.com', 'text': " An historic first flight between Israel and the United Arab Emirates has taken place, following a normalization agreement between the two countries.

First constructed in the Byzantine period, it served primarily as an Orthodox Christian basilica for nearly a millennium, from when the first Orthodox prayers were held there in 537 CE to its capture by Ottoman forces in 1453.The Hagia Sophia was thus converted into a mosque upon its conquest in 1453, a status that lasted for hundreds of years until the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the establishment of the modern Turkish state. Turkey’s first president, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, a secular modernist, closed the mosque in 1931 and opened a museum in its place in 1935, a move he championed as representative of his wishes to break Turkey of its overtly Muslim and Ottoman roots. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });Erdoğan has championed the July 10 decision as a fulfillment of the desires of both the Turkish people and the historical conquerors of Istanbul, declaring that “with this court ruling, and with the measures we took in line with the decision, Hagia Sophia became a mosque again, after 86 years, in the way Fatih [Sultan Mehmed II], the conqueror of Istanbul, had wanted it to be.”The move appears in line with Erdoğan’s brand of political leadership, a political agenda numerous political analysts have come to call “Erdoğanism.” Under his rule of Turkey since 2003, there has been a shift away from “Kemalism,” Atatürk’s secular modernization. Instead, Erdoğan and his Justice and Development Party (AKP) represent a form of Turkish nationalism based upon conservative and traditional Islamic values. Erdoğan’s policies have often led Turkey to find itself at odds with the Western world and domestic opponents, over both domestic issues (accusations of authoritarianism, pandering to Islamists, and the dismantling of Turkish democracy) and foreign issues (including handling of the Syrian refugee crisis, the status of Cyprus’ sovereignty, and military deals between Turkey and Russia).Global reactions to Turkey’s conversion of the Hagia Sophia have been largely negative, including that of US State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus, who on July 10 stated: “We are disappointed by the decision of the government of Turkey to change the status of the Hagia Sophia.This building is an important part of the ‘Historic Sites of Istanbul’ UNESCO World Heritage Site, in recognition of its rich multicultural history. We understand the Turkish government remains committed to maintaining access to the Hagia Sophia for all visitors and look forward to hearing its plans for continued stewardship of the Hagia Sophia to ensure it remains accessible without impediment for all.”International and regional bodies, prominent faith leaders and other sovereign states have all warned of the repercussions of the recent decision, including UNESCO, the EU and Pope Francis of the Roman Catholic Church. The Greek government has been particularly critical of the move, with Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis calling it “an affront to civilization of the 21st century.” The Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch (head of the Eastern Orthodox Church) Bartholomew I warned on July 9 that Hagia Sophia “belongs not only to those who own it at the moment but to all humanity.” An In-Depth Look Critical of the MoveEndy Zemenides offered his reaction to the move as the executive director of the Hellenic American Leadership Council (HALC), an organization dedicated to cultivating Greek American community leaders in the United States.Reflecting first on the logistics of the conversion, Zemenides heavily doubts Turkish claims of being able to maintain access to long-standing Christian mosaics in the now ex-museum. He is skeptical of Turkish plans to cover these mosaics with curtains during Muslim prayer, and over Turkish plans to install rods and carpet in the historic structure.Even if the mosaics are covered only during designated Islamic prayer time, Zemenides says that such a move “robs the Hagia Sophia of its status as a symbol of unity and shared human experience.” Pointing to the fact that this conversion was carried out hurriedly, within a span of 14 days, and that it took place without consultation with UNESCO, Zemenides worries that the process was conducted with “no commitment to truly preserving Christian heritage,” and “with open disregard for the feelings and opinions of religious minorities in Turkey.”Zemenides further maintains that anti-Christian rhetoric revolving around the mosaics is troubling. He specifically points to the controversial tweets by Turkish professor of history at Sakarya University Ebubekir Sofuoğlu, who called for the removal of the mosaic of Byzantine Christian Empress Zoe, an 11th-century imperial figure central to Byzantine history and the Orthodox faith in Istanbul. Sofuoğlu found rumors of alleged promiscuity in Zoe’s personal life as unbecoming for a female figure whose image is to be found in a mosque.Politically, Zemenides rejects the notion that the dispute over the Hagia Sophia is strictly an isolated geopolitical issue concerning Greece and Turkey, or even simply the Western world and Turkey. Rather, Zemenides sees this dispute as being about the lack of religious pluralism in Turkey today. He sees Turkish actions regarding the Hagia Sophia as directly reflective of this troubling trend, emphasized by the symbolism of the head of Turkey’s Religious Affairs Directorate, Ali Erbaş, holding up a sword during the opening sermon given in the mosque on July 24.With Erbaş stating that “Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror [Mehmed II] dedicated this magnificent construction to believers to remain a mosque until the Day of Resurrection,” Zemenides sees Turkey as “pushing the envelope” when it comes to relations with its religious minorities. He sees this sermon as a direct signal to Turkey’s religious minorities (Greeks, Armenians, Jews, Syriacs) that “they are conquered minorities living under the sword” of the modern Turkish state, a nation that is becoming ever more aggressive and alienating toward these minorities.Besides the symbolism he finds in the “right of the sword” being used in Turkey’s branding of its Hagia Sophia move, Zemenides points toward Turkey’s troublesome record with religious minorities, both before and during Erdoğan’s administration. Citing the 2020 United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) report on Turkey, which describes “the perpetuation of restrictive and intrusive governmental policies on religious practice and a marked increase in incidents of vandalism and societal violence against religious minorities,” Zemenides asserts that the conversion of the Hagia Sophia is “part of a broader situation for religious minorities in Turkey that is constantly deteriorating.”Zemenides cites the decision two years ago to convert another Istanbul museum and former church, Chora, into a mosque as having foreshadowed the Hagia Sophia move. Recalling the closure of the last Orthodox Christian seminary in Turkey, Halki, in 1971, alongside the decline in the population of Turkish religious minorities in the past decades, he blames the international community for “giving Turkey a free pass for far too long, and for letting them get way with zero accountability.” A Response from Turkish OfficialsMeanwhile, the Turkish Consulate General in Chicago rejects many of the allegations put forth by groups like the HALC.Consul General Ayşe Selcan Şanlı, who is in charge of the Turkish diplomatic mission in Chicago, rejects the idea that the decision to change Hagia Sophia’s status was by any means a calculated political move, an accusation made by critics who accuse Erdoğan of converting the structure to garner support after the failed coup d’état attempt against him in 2016 and the losses his AKP experienced in municipal elections in 2019.Rather, the mission says the Hagia Sophia’s conversion from a museum to a mosque was “not a decision by President Erdoğan but rather a decision made by the courts.”It reiterates that Turkey’s highest administrative court, the Council of State, was the governmental body that reversed the 1935 conversion of the Hagia Sophia into a museum, and despite being a move encouraged by Erdoğan, it was not strictly pushed through solely on his accord. Similarly, the Turkish Consulate General points to the lack of widespread vocal opposition to the move by the Republican People’s Party (CHP), Turkey’s main opposition party, as emblematic of national unity in the decision to convert the Hagia Sophia back into a mosque.The diplomatic mission also alleges that the decision was “not something new. While perhaps this [decision] was new for people outside of Turkey, they don’t know what the Turkish people want, but this is the will and desire of our people. This decision was the decision on the basis of the desire of our people.That is the benefit of this decision and we do not see the harm of it to anyone.”The Consulate General furthermore denies this decision was antithetical to the secular and modernizing reforms characteristic of Kemalism, the political ideology that led to Atatürk’s 1931 decision regarding the Hagia Sophia.The Consulate General does not blame Atatürk for his decision, however, claiming that in 1931 the choice may have been correct given the political and historical context of the era, whereas now, the Turkish people have different needs than those in 1931.In response to questions regarding the widespread international criticism of the move, the Consulate General maintains that “the Turkish government is well aware of its [the Hagia Sophia’s] outstanding cultural, historical and spiritual value. But eventually, it is our cultural heritage site and it is in Istanbul, and it is to be seen as a domestic issue that is a matter of sovereignty.”The Consulate General also reiterated that the site will not be exclusive to Muslims. Outside of designated prayer times, it “should be open to everyone and all,” and it was indeed “a fine decision to let anyone (Muslim or non-Muslim) outside of prayer time to visit, as it is a cultural heritage site.” The mission also made clear it believes that this decision could perhaps benefit the religious minorities of Turkey, as the site will no longer be a museum that charges fees for entry, but will rather be free of charge for all visitors.In regards to further questions regarding religious minorities in Turkey, the Consulate General maintains this decision should not be seen as offensive to such groups when one recalls that from 1453 until 1931 the structure was indeed a mosque. The delegation also emphasizes that this decision was not taken to spite the religious minorities, but rather to please the apparent collective will of much of the population of Turkey, a nation where 99.8% of people are Muslim. Furthermore, the Consulate General denies claims of hostility toward minority religions and asserts that under the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, Turkey has treated its religious minorities fairly and with respect, allowing them to have both places of worship and the freedom to pray (a claim USCIRF rejects). A Look ForwardWith the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, calling the Hagia Sophia decision “regrettable,” Turkey’s chances of joining the EU, something Ankara has been pursuing for years, seem to have suffered a blow.In addition to European and international opposition to the move, domestic opponents and political pundits have declared the decision a political stunt meant to garner popular support for Erdoğan’s government among its nationalist and Islamist base, especially after the failed 2016 coup d’état, recent electoral defeats in local elections, and an economic downturn due to the global COVID-19 pandemic.While the Turkish government maintains the Hagia Sophia move to be a matter of Turkish sovereignty and fulfilling the wishes of the national psyche, the conversion of the building has continued to be criticized worldwide, with Greek Culture Minister Lina Mendoni on July 10 labeling it “an open provocation to the civilized world which recognizes the unique value and ecumenical nature of the monument.” Philip Rapaport is a student in The Media Line’s Press and Policy Student Program.

This refers to the operational bases of a foreign intelligence service, disguised in an official [e.g. embassy, consulate general] or semi-official [e.g. press agency, airline] representation in the host country as a starting point for intelligence activities.” cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });According to the Saarland intelligence document, “The intelligence staff there, supposedly working as diplomats or journalists, conduct open or covert information gathering themselves or provide support in intelligence operations that are carried out directly by the headquarters of the intelligence services in their home countries. In addition, intelligence services also carry out operations without their legal residences being involved. The focus of their respective procurement activities is based on current political requirements or economic priorities.”The intelligence officials noted that China and Iran replicate Russia’s brutal tactics in targeting dissidents and opponents within the federal republic. “The Iranian and Chinese intelligence services are also active in this field.”The report says that for Iran to achieve its goal, “selected people from the opposition movement are approached with the aim of a commitment to intelligence cooperation. In the event of rejection, the persons concerned or their relatives living in their home country are often threatened with reprisals.”Iran’s regime has used German territory for surveillance and assassination operations targeting Iranian dissidents, pro-Israel advocates and Israeli and Jewish institutions.Germany’s 16 federal states have their own local domestic intelligence service. Each state releases an annual report documenting threats to the democratic order of the state.The Saarland noted the apparent illicit nuclear weapons activities of Pakistan in Germany and elsewhere abroad. “Pakistan also operates an extensive nuclear and carrier technology program and continues to endeavor to expand and modernize, in order to retain a serious deterrent potential against the ‘Arch enemy’ India.” "}, {'id': '46988cca-ec25-11ea-8093-fdd8c08b34d7', '__typename': 'Article', 'createdAt': '2020-09-01T07:32:24.770Z', 'updatedAt': '2020-09-01T07:32:24.770Z', 'mercuryObj': {'title': 'Morocco rejects normalizing ties with Israel -PM', 'author': None, 'date_published': None, 'dek': None, 'lead_image_url': 'https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/t_JD_ArticleMainImageFaceDetect/437985', 'next_page_url': None, 'url': 'https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/morocco-rejects-normalizing-ties-with-israel-pm-639698', 'domain': 'www.jpost.com', 'excerpt': 'The remarks came ahead of a visit to the region by Jared Kushner, a senior adviser and son-in-law to U.S. President Donald Trump, and after the UAE and Israel struck a deal to normalize ties.', 'word_count': 131, 'direction': 'ltr', 'total_pages': 1, 'rendered_pages': 1, 'source': 'www.jpost.com'}, 'url': 'https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/morocco-rejects-normalizing-ties-with-israel-pm-639698', 'category': 'armiger', 'subcategory': None, 'absSum': None, 'title': 'Morocco rejects normalizing ties with Israel -PM', 'source': 'www.jpost.com', 'text': 'RABAT - Moroccan Prime Minister Saad Dine El Otmani on Sunday rejected any normalization of relations with Israel.“We refuse any normalization with the Zionist entity because this emboldens it to go further in breaching the rights of the Palestinian people,” El Otmani told his Islamist PJD party.The remarks came ahead of a visit to the region by Jared Kushner, a senior adviser and son-in-law to US President Donald Trump, and after the UAE and Israel struck a deal to normalize ties.Morocco’s official position has been in support of the two-state solution, with East Jerusalem as capital of a Palestinian state.Morocco and Israel began low-level ties in 1993 after an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal was reached.

Under the terms of the understandings, they say, Israel promised to ease restrictions imposed on the Gaza Strip in return for a cessation of incendiary balloon and rocket attacks. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });Israel was “exploiting” the recent increase of coronavirus cases in the Gaza Strip to “step up its pressure on the Palestinian factions,” a source told the Post.According to the sources, Israel believes Hamas is under pressure because of the coronavirus outbreak among the general population in the Gaza Strip, which has been under curfew for the past six days to prevent the spread of the disease.“Despite the outbreak of the coronavirus, the Palestinian factions told al-Emadi that if Israel does not comply with their demands, they are prepared for an all-out military confrontation,” a source said.Emadi, for his part, has informed the factions that Doha was waiting for a green light from Israel to deliver another cash grant to the Gaza Strip.A Hamas official said Qatar has pledged another $30 million in financial aid to thousands of families in the Gaza Strip as part of a new ceasefire agreement with Israel.“On Saturday night, it seemed we were close to reaching a new agreement [with Israel],” the official said. “It’s not clear why Israel keeps coming up with new demands.”The official said he did not rule out the possibility that Israel was deliberately working to undermine the Qatari mediation efforts in order to bring the Egyptian mediators back into the picture.“It’s also possible that Israel is paving the way for the United Arab Emirates to replace Qatar as the main player in the Gaza Strip conflict,” he said.In 2017, Egypt, the UAE, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia severed diplomatic relations with Qatar, citing its alleged support for terrorism as the main reason.

It is investing in precision bombs, better guidance and other “leaps forward,” the report said.It was not clear when the exhibition took place. But Fars News devoted a large segment to looking at the new capabilities of Iran’s weapons, which could threaten the US, Israel and allies in the region.What is important in Iran is to showcase standardization and mass production of several successful and historic lines of drones, including the Ababil series, the Mohajer and now the Karar and Fotros.The Karar is actually a kind of cruise missile, or kamikaze drone. The Fotros looks like it was designed as a copy of Israel’s IAI Heron.Many Iranian drone models are copies of US drones that Iran has captured, although it has also built copies of Israeli drones and weapons.Iran’s original 1980s drones were relatively innovative and unique. But it now wants copies of US models, such as the Predator and Sentinel, or Israel’s Elbit Hermes 450 either for propaganda reasons or airworthiness. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });What has Iran achieved now? It claims it now has retractable landing gear for the rarely seen Fotros.A new prototype, based on a 2013 version, is flying. Iran displayed the new drone with a bunch of existing models as if it was part of a kind of safari of military equipment.Oddly, the Ministry of Defense left it to Fars News to speculate on the abilities of these drones. Iran has achieved new types of missiles, including “vertical armor-piercing bombs,” Iranian media reported.We have seen these tested before, and they are also copies of foreign munitions. Iran says it also has upgraded its Mohajer-6, part of the family of drones in this class.The dual-take drone is also a copy of foreign models, perhaps based on the Denel Dynamics Seeker from South Africa, which is based on Israeli successes with similar types of drones.Iran has armed the Mohajer-6 with bombs under each wing and has published video of them striking targets. It has used them against Kurdish dissident groups, Tehran said.Iran’s Karar drone, which is basically a cruise missile, can fly some 900 km. with a 250-kg. warhead, it said. It has invested in what it calls a Simorgh bomb, Iran said.There is some lack of clarity about this term. Simorgh is also the name of a launch vehicle Iran uses, and it is supposedly a class of drones as well.Iran said it armed this drone with an MK-82 bomb and a guidance system. Bizarrely, it seems to have basically taken a drone whose origins go back to the V-1 and the Teledyne Ryan Firebee and lashed a bomb onto it.This is odd because the Iranians could just use this drone as a cruise missile, being that it does not seem to be able to return to base anyway.There is lack of clarity about what Iran seeks to achieve using its increasing investment in these kinds of kamikaze drones. It used them against Saudi Arabia last September, and they are effective.However, it is unclear why it would put more munitions on them. Iran seems to want to experiment with adding more bombs and guidance to its growing arsenal until it finds the right mix for drones and loitering munitions and cruise missiles.The overall goal is to give the country a large number of abilities to threaten sophisticated adversaries, such as the US and Israel, by being able to field maneuverable munitions that also have their own bombs attached.Iran may sense that Western air-defense systems will have difficulty dealing with a complex threat like this. It is already known that Iran pioneered precision-guided munitions, and adding these capabilities to drones seems to be its goal.

That is real. That is concrete.”1/3A lovely meeting with my close friend @HeikoMaas. at the site of Villa Lieberman.We spoke about future collaboration between Israel and Germany in the fields of trade, economics, medicine, research and security. pic.twitter.com/CPz8Mql0k1— גבי אשכנזי - Gabi Ashkenazi (@Gabi_Ashkenazi) August 27, 2020 His comments were intended to assuage European Union fears about annexation and help ease tensions and repair ties with European countries, including Germany, which had warned against sovereignty moves.Ashkenazi’s remarks came in the aftermath of the historic announcement of a burgeoning US-brokered agreement to normalize relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates in exchange for the suspension of plans by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to annex West Bank settlements.But within hours after Ashkenazi (Blue and White) said normalization had replaced annexation, Likud sources attempted to weaken his diplomatic power while he was still in Germany. They said he was not authorized to represent the State of Israel on this matter, even though he is the foreign minister.Ashkenazi’s words were “ridiculous,” and “the government is paralyzed,” Knesset Speaker Yariv Levin, one Netanyahu’s closest confidants, told Channel 13.The government was working to both strengthen its hold in Judea and Samaria and to seek peace, he said. Blue and White was acting as if it was an “opposition” force from within the government, he added. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });On Thursday, cabinet ministers received a message that their weekly meeting had been canceled for the fourth week in a row. The reason given was that important diplomatic meetings had been set for Sunday.The cabinet has not met the past three weeks due to disputes that have not been resolved over how the government should function and how to pass the budget.Thursday’s battle over Ashkenazi’s words was just the latest in that crisis.“Gabi Ashkenazi knew nothing about Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s historic peace agreement with the Emirates, so his remarks are irrelevant,” a Likud source said.“Prime Minister Netanyahu has worked for many years to bring about this historic peace agreement, and other peace agreements that are on the way, under the principle of peace for peace and not territories for peace,” which the Left advocated in the past, the source said.It was “ridiculous” that Ashkenazi and others in his party were trying to rob Netanyahu of credit for the deal and the unprecedented benefits that Israel has reaped as a result, the source said.In response, a Blue and White source said the Likud should stop being so “sour” and instead welcome normalization and the manner in which “peace and security” had replaced “irresponsible unilateral measures.”The battle underscored the deep philosophical division between the two parties, which earlier this week narrowly averted leading the country to a fourth election.Annexation was still on the agenda, Netanyahu has said, and normalization with Arab countries was based on “peace for peace.”The United States has reiterated that the UAE deal has “suspended” annexation and has not given a timeline for when it can be executed.Ashkenazi and Alternative Prime Minister Benny Gantz have long opposed unilateral annexation and would prefer to see settlements become part of Israel through consensus with the Palestinians and the Arab world.Some settlers have feared that normalization means the end to any such hope that settlements would be annexed to Israel and fear that the concept of a two-state solution at the pre-1967 lines has been revived.Upon hearing Ashkenazi say that “annexation is out, peace is in,” Peace Now said it is embarrassing how hard the Likud works to hide what is clear to everyone – that Israel has forsaken annexation for peace.While in Berlin, Ashkenazi appealed to the Palestinians to negotiate.“I would like to say we are still keeping the door open for the Palestinians,” he said. “We hope the Palestinians will join the table to negotiate the process... Now it is up to [them].”The UAE-Israel deal “is a very strong demonstration that only through dialogue and negotiation can we make progress,” Ashkenazi said, adding that he hoped other Arab countries would also normalize ties.In their comments, Ashkenazi and Maas alluded to the fact that Israel’s suspension of annexation had already opened renewed possibilities for Israel in Europe.During Ashkenazi’s two-day trip to Germany, his first abroad since becoming foreign minister in May, he attended an informal meeting of EU foreign ministers. It is unusual for a high-level Israeli official to participate in such a meeting.Germany, which holds the rotating six-month European Council presidency through the end of December, extended the invitation.The last time it happened was in 2017, when Netanyahu joined an informal breakfast gathering of EU foreign ministers.Ashkenazi’s presence marked a break in the otherwise tense relations between Israel and the EU, which are divided on issues relating to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Iran.“We have to maintain an open and honest dialogue with Europe,” Ashkenazi said, adding that he hoped his trip would be the start of that new conversation.“Many things had become easier” now that Israel had suspended its annexation plans, Maas said.Both Iran and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict were the subject of Ashkenazi’s conversations with Maas, the EU foreign ministers and High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell.“The EU and Israel are ready to continue to work together,” Borrell tweeted after their meeting.Good meeting with Israeli FM @Gabi_Ashkenazi in Berlin. I congratulated him on the normalisation of relations with the UAE. The EU and Israel are ready to continue to work together pic.twitter.com/c1Z82mdBzd— Josep Borrell Fontelles (@JosepBorrellF) August 27, 2020 But in their public remarks, both Ashkenazi and Maas glossed over those differences.Regarding Tehran, Ashkenazi said: “Iran repeatedly used terror activities and armed regional militias, from Hezbollah in Lebanon to the Houthis in Yemen, Palestinian terrorists in Gaza. It is really undermining the stability in the region.”Maas said he shares Israel’s concerns about Iran, particularly its access to sophisticated weapons.Germany believes Iran is best held in check through the 2015 Iran deal, while Israel maintains that it must be replaced with international sanctions.“We do share an intimate, special relationship, Germany and Israel,” Ashkenazi said.He thanked Maas for his commitment to preserving both the memory of the Holocaust and to the security of the modern State of Israel.

For instance, days ago Turkish pro-government media indicated that the Turkish naval flotilla stalking the Mediterranean off Greece would be coming home.Then the UAE sent F-16s to Crete to train with the Greeks, and the US slammed Turkey for hosting the Hamas terrorist group. Greece launched military exercises with France, Italy and Cyprus in the Eastern Mediterranean on Wednesday. The French sent Rafael jets and a frigate.France’s Minister of the Armed Forces, Florence Parly, said that Paris wants cooperation and does not want the sea becoming an area of instability.“It should not be a playground for the ambitions of some,” she said, in words aimed at Ankara. Al-Ain media in the Gulf is excited that France is joining the drills.Turkey is riding a wave of extremist nationalism and religious intolerance being pushed by the ruling AK Party. The party recently turned two historic churches into mosques in Istanbul, and has increasingly held rallies by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in which the country threatens to “liberate” Jerusalem’s al-Aqsa Mosque from Israel and threatens Greece, the UAE, Egypt and other countries.Turkey has invaded parts of northern Syria and ethnically cleansed the Kurdish region of Afrin. Turkey also continues to bomb areas in northern Iraq where minority Christians and Yazidis live. Turkey claims this is all part of an “anti-terror campaign,” even though there have been no terrorist attacks in Turkey in recent years. Meanwhile, actual ISIS terrorists continue to escape detention in eastern Syria to get to Turkey. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });As part of the wave of extremism in Ankara, there are growing demands to take over part of the Mediterranean. Turkey said on August 26 that it would make no concessions to Athens, after saying it wanted talks with no preconditions on Wednesday.The BBC and CNN are taking notice of the tensions now, looking into why NATO members Greece and Turkey are at odds. The US sent the USS Hershel Woody to the Mediterranean amid the tensions. The Russians could send more ships to the Mediterranean as well.Overall, the posture of France, the US, UAE, Greece and others is attempting to send a message to Turkey that its continued threats are taken seriously.Turkey has a long history of making threats and provoking various crises to its benefit. Just days ago, it seemed Turkey had turned its attention from the Mediterranean basin, was seeking talks and boasting about energy discoveries in the Black Sea. This would suggest that Turkey doesn’t need to explore energy sources in Greek-claimed waters. However, comments on Wednesday and France’s comments illustrate that the tensions don’t appear to be dying down.

The El Al plane, bearing an Israeli flag, was also the first-ever Israeli flight over Saudi Arabia.The countries’ foreign ministries, along with American representatives, worked on the details of the normalization deal and other bilateral agreements between the countries.Foreign Ministry Director-General Alon Ushpiz said: “We are starting a historic process and we plan to promote the institution of full relations and opening embassies in the two countries as soon as possible to strengthen the cooperation between Israel and the UAE.“Movement of people, goods and finance is the central key to realizing the great potential in the relations,” Ushpiz added.Ben-Shabbat and his Emirati counterpart, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed, held a lengthy meeting.Israeli and Emirati officials in other areas like science and space, civil aviation, foreign policy and diplomacy, tourism, finance, health and more met for round-table discussions of possible opportunities for cooperation, often with an American facilitator. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });The Jerusalem Post was allowed to get brief glimpses of some of the professional talks on condition that the officials would not be quoted. Most of the rooms were set up with U-shaped tables, with Emirati men in white robes and headdresses on one side, facing Israelis on the other side.The governments of the UAE hosted a tour and dinner for Israeli journalists at the Louvre Abu Dhabi, with kosher food for those who requested it, and discussions with officials from a range of cultural, scientific and diplomatic areas, speaking on condition of anonymity.One official emphasized that peace between Israel and the UAE would be different from that between Israel and Egypt or Jordan, because the people of the UAE plan to take an active part in that peace.Netanyahu made similar comments in a press conference in Jerusalem Monday evening, saying peace with the UAE will be a “warm peace,” based on economic cooperation.Another official pointed out similarities between Israelis and Emiratis, citing a drive for success and innovation.An Emirati diplomat in her twenties said she expects many locals to visit Israel when there are regular flights between the countries, and said many have expressed interest in seeing Jerusalem.Earlier, when the El Al flight landed at Abu Dhabi International Airport, the delegation was met by UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash.Ben-Shabbat greeted his Emirati hosts and local press in Arabic, saying that he is “proud and very happy to be here as the head of the Israeli delegation.“We came here to turn the vision into reality,” he said. “There is no limit to the possible cooperation between us in science, innovation, health, aviation, agriculture, energy and many other areas.”Ben-Shabbat called on more countries to join them in peace.In a press conference in Jerusalem, Netanyahu invited a UAE delegation to Israel to be “welcomed on a red carpet, as well.”“I felt an immense pride,” Netanyahu said after seeing Israeli flags waving in Abu Dhabi. “This is a new age in our history.Suggesting Israel is in talks with other Arab states, Netanyahu said: “There are many things I cannot tell you, but I am sure you will find out in time.”Asked on the plane which Middle Eastern countries may make peace with Israel next, Kushner chuckled, saying: “I know the people in Israel well, and when there’s an accomplishment, they say ‘what’s next?’ I’m going to ask the Israeli people for just one day... let’s take a moment to celebrate.”O’Brien said he is “hopeful this will be the first step in creating momentum... [that] will lead to other nations deciding it is in their best interests to normalize ties with Israel.”Kushner said the Saudis are “very gracious” for allowing the first Israeli flight in their airspace, and that the flight is “a manifestation of what is possible in the Middle East.”“We can take it as a sign,” Kushner said. “It’s an encouragement for this progress.”The special adviser commended Netanyahu and Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Mohammed bin Zayed for their “great leadership.”Netanyahu radioed in a message to the plane while it was flying over Saudi Arabia, saying the delegation on the plane is “opening the door to a different kind of peace. Peace with investments, peace with tourism, peace with many fruits and peace that will be between our two nations and all the nations of the region.”On the flight to the UAE, Kushner addressed the Trump peace plan and its allowing for Israel to extend its sovereignty to parts of Judea and Samaria.Israel is “going to be focused right now on the relationship with the UAE. I think that’ll make peace, in time, with the Palestinians, much more possible,” he said.Still, he added, “President Trump likes to leave his options open.”Annexation was included in the plan because it was clear that “in the context of any agreement, Israel wasn’t going to give up that territory,” and the US “had to make sure Israel’s security was protected.”Recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and potentially recognizing Israeli sovereignty in the West Bank would “take those provocative issues off the table.”Kushner criticized the Palestinians for rejecting the Trump plan even before it was published in January.“Certain people like division and the status quo for whatever reason,” he said.On the tarmac in Abu Dhabi, Kushner said of the Palestinians: “We can’t want peace more than they want peace. When they are ready, the whole region wants to move forward, but they can’t be stuck in the past... Peace and opportunity will be ready for them as soon as they are ready to embrace it.” "}, {'id': '4c3ced5f-ec25-11ea-8093-fdd8c08b34d7', '__typename': 'Article', 'createdAt': '2020-09-01T07:32:33.387Z', 'updatedAt': '2020-09-01T07:32:33.387Z', 'mercuryObj': {'title': 'Health Ministry: Sinai border crossing can be open for Israeli travelers', 'author': None, 'date_published': None, 'dek': None, 'lead_image_url': 'https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/t_JD_ArticleMainImageFaceDetect/441104', 'next_page_url': None, 'url': 'https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/health-ministry-sinai-border-crossing-can-be-open-for-israeli-travelers-640517', 'domain': 'www.jpost.com', 'excerpt': 'Travelers will be expected to undergo the mandatory 14-day quarantine period upon their return.', 'word_count': 343, 'direction': 'ltr', 'total_pages': 1, 'rendered_pages': 1, 'source': 'www.jpost.com'}, 'url': 'https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/health-ministry-sinai-border-crossing-can-be-open-for-israeli-travelers-640517', 'category': 'armiger', 'subcategory': None, 'absSum': None, 'title': 'Health Ministry: Sinai border crossing can be open for Israeli travelers', 'source': 'www.jpost.com', 'text': ' The Health Ministry announced Sunday that the Sinai border crossing between Israel and Egypt could open to Israeli travelers, as long as these travelers respect the 14-day quarantine period upon their return.So far, less than 100,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported in Egypt, with a population of 100 million (the rate is similar to Israel) and the Egyptian morbidity rate, reported to be 5.5%, about one-tenth of Israel\'s, was said to be decreasing in August. The Sinai is divided into two parts, northern and southern. On the southern part, characterized by its touristic beaches, the Egyptian administration has declared it a "coronavirus-free" territory. In practice, there are only a few cases reported, and they are geographically spread. The Egyptian government is transmitting tough enforcement of anti-infection procedures. However, it is not known exactly what the situation is, but it is clear that the administration is interested in keeping these places corona-free because they are an important source of income.It is doubtful whether Egypt\'s official data faithfully reflects the morbidity picture in the country, especially in light of the low testing rate and the high lethality rate. The possibility of under-diagnosis and under-reporting by Egypt cannot be ruled out. In addition, Egypt is not a green country, therefore, every passenger returning from this country is required to have 14 days of quarantine, a requirement that greatly reduces the possibility of creating infection chains as a result of tourists returning from this country. In this sense, the situation is no different from in any other country to which Israelis are travelling. It should be emphasized that in the current situation, there is no impediment to leaving and returning to Israel after a stay in Egypt and the Sinai Peninsula through indirect flights. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: \'36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b\' }).render(\'4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6\'); });The position of the Health Ministry is that it is possible to allow the opening of the border crossing with Sinai to Israeli passengers, subject to compliance with the rules of the Health Ministry, including a ban on public transportation to quarantine, except for taxis.

For years, they provided the Palestinian leadership with generous financial support and diplomatic assistance. Indeed, the Palestinian issue is a core issue in the conscience of residents of the Arab Gulf. Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the UAE’s founding father, was well aware of this reality and chose to keep the Palestinian issue close to his heart.However, after his death, many conditions changed in the region. The Arab Spring marked the collapse of several regimes and the rise of new ones, while Iran’s aggression in the region continued to spread and intensify. To make matters worse, the Palestinian people experienced an internal rift that led to their de facto separation into two states: one in the West Bank and another in the Gaza Strip. This gave room for Iran to expand its influence over Hamas in Gaza, much like it did with Hezbollah in Lebanon.So what should we make of the recent agreement between the UAE and Israel, brokered by the United States?Allow me to begin by saying that I’m not among the people who believe that talking to the Israelis and negotiating with them is a crime. In fact, the only way to deal with a conflict is to talk to your enemy. And history has taught us that harsh and painful negotiations are better than a bloody war. For years, we, in the Arab world, tried to pursue strategies of boycott against Israel. But they failed. Now the UAE has opened the page for dealing with Israel through negotiations. I, for one, prefer a known devil over an unknown angel. I’d rather see the relations and communications between the two countries be carried out openly than under the table.Therefore, the Israeli-Emirati agreement is a huge step for the Palestinian people. It will reshape the way in which the Arab world approaches the Palestinian cause and pave the way toward a new strategy that may be more beneficial than approaches we’ve tried before.I am sure that Gulf leaders, including in the UAE, have not relinquished their support for the Palestinian people. They are still defending their inalienable rights and protecting their interests against anyone who tries to undermine them. Arabism and Arab solidarity are indivisible. And defending the Palestinian cause through direct negotiations with Israel, in broad daylight, is a thousand times better than doing so secretly, behind closed doors. – Moustafa Elfeki  cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });BUREAUCRACY AND THE AMBITION OF SAUDI WOMENAl Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, August 21 As a young girl, Amal al-Awami knew that she wanted to become a physician. Despite being told that she wasn’t fit for the job, she continued to fight for her dream. She eventually became an ophthalmologist. Despite growing up in a traditional community, Fatima al-Sayed Hassan al-Awami and her cousin Amal al-Sayed Ali al-Awami were among the first three Saudi engineers working for Saudi Aramco in the early 1980s. The two women did not let men dictate their careers, even when they were told, time and again, that engineering is a discipline reserved strictly for men.Thankfully, this legacy continues to this very day among most circles of Saudi society. More and more young women are choosing to pursue careers in science and technology while celebrating their achievements as well as those of other women. But there is still work to be done.Yasmeen AlFaraj is a Saudi scholar who was sent by the King Abdullah University to study in the United States, at the University of California, Berkeley, one of the most prestigious universities in the world. A passion for science led AlFaraj to graduate with distinction and get accepted to a doctoral program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. MIT offered AlFaraj a spot to complete her doctorate in chemistry with a specialization in polymers and soft materials without the need to first obtain a master’s degree. This is because her academic achievements were so exceptional, and because the university provides only a combined master’s and doctoral-level program.Despite rejoicing in her achievement, AlFaraj faced a bureaucratic nightmare with the Saudi Education Ministry, which refused to provide her with a much-needed scholarship due to the fact that she had only a bachelor’s degree. Ironically, at the exact same time that Saudi women are finally being empowered, in accordance with Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, many of the rigid old structures disadvantaging women continue to plague our society. So instead of receiving the help she needed, AlFaraj was turned away from the ministry by a disgruntled bureaucrat who had no appreciation for her incredible talent. The man had no idea of what it means to be accepted to the University of California, Berkeley, or to a doctoral program at MIT. Instead of being supportive and encouraging the young woman to chase her dreams, he followed a rigid protocol.If Saudi Arabia is truly serious about becoming an innovative society that stands at the forefront of technological innovation, it must embrace not only its sons but also its daughters. Archaic government programs and protocols place an obstacle not only in front of AlFaraj but in front of all talented, ambitious, and gifted Saudi women who are exceptional in their respective fields, yet fall short of being recognized or supported by their society. – Hassan al-MustafaTHE UN IS FAILING LIBYAAl-Ittihad, UAE, August 22 The mission to end the Libyan crisis does not require the appointment of a new UN envoy to Libya, who will be the seventh to assume this title since 2011. Things will not change overnight simply because a new liaison is appointed. Indeed, it is highly unlikely, if not outright impossible, that a new envoy would succeed in doing what six others before him failed to do.Following the resignation of the most recent envoy, Ghassan Salame, from the post in early March, the position of UN Libya envoy has remained vacant. The five permanent members of the UN Security Council could not agree on the identity of Salame’s successor, especially since the United States demanded to split the role into two separate portfolios.Unfortunately, UN Secretary-General António Guterres thinks that envoys can just be deployed without any institutional support. However, no UN envoy can achieve progress in conflict resolution without adequate support from the United Nations Secretariat. Such support cannot be provided without the clear vision of the secretary-general. In the absence of such a vision, it is impossible to develop a plan on the basis of which, and in the light of which, the envoy can act.In most cases the existence of such a vision requires courage. The secretary-general and his assistants in the UN Secretariat must confront countries about their role in prolonging a given conflict and demand action on their behalf. It is no secret that there are several major countries that are directly involved in the Libyan war. Despite this, the UN Secretariat turns a blind eye to this behavior. Instead of leveraging its power to promote a peace deal in the country, the UN is allowing an illegal regime to continue ruling Libya with the help and support of foreign mercenaries who have been imported to the country from afar.The United Nations Secretariat is a body with extensive power and substantial leverage over member states. However, the ability to exercise this power depends on the secretary-general and his readiness to take bold actions. Dag Hammarskjöld (1953-1961) and Boutros Boutros-Ghali (1992-1996) were two secretaries-general who weren’t afraid to make a difference. The current one, Guterres, is quickly running out of time to live up to their legacy. – Wahid Abdul Majeed Translated by Asaf Zilberfarb.

It was agreed that the agency will carry out its independent and professional responsibilities," said Salehi, head of Iran\'s Atomic Energy Organization, according to multiple Iranian news agencies."A new chapter of cooperation between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency will start." \xa0The IAEA had not yet issued a statement by Tuesday following the visit.The Monday visit was the director-general’s first to the country since he took office last December. Just prior to the visit, the IAEA said that, "During his discussions in Tehran, Director Grossi will address the cooperation of Iran with the IAEA, and in particular Iran’s provision of access to the Agency’s inspectors to requested locations. “I have decided to come personally to Tehran so that I can reinforce the importance of cooperation and the full implementation of all safeguards, commitments and obligations with the IAEA,” Grossi said.  cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: \'36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b\' }).render(\'4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6\'); });“My objective is that my meetings in Tehran will lead to concrete progress in addressing the outstanding questions that the agency has related to safeguards in Iran and, in particular, to resolve the issue of access,” he said, adding that “I also hope to establish a fruitful and cooperative channel of direct dialogue with the Iranian government which will be valuable now and in the future.”\xa0\xa0 \xa0In June, the IAEA Board of Governors issued the first condemnation of Iran in almost a decade for lack of compliance both in granting access to two disputed nuclear sites and in clearing up the origin of illicit nuclear material found by inspectors at the Turquzabad site.The Board of Governors’ vote came at Grossi\'s request, with the current IAEA chief being more willing to publicly push around the Islamic Republic than his predecessor, Yukiya Amano.Israeli intelligence officials believe that one reason Grossi is more willing to pressure the ayatollahs is that he was not part of forming the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, whereas Amano viewed the deal as a sacrosanct piece of his legacy.At the same time, it is unclear whether Grossi can bring more pressure to bear on Tehran than a public scolding, since the UN Security Council recently rejected US attempts to extend an arms embargo on Iran and is expected to reject its attempts to snap back global sanctions.Alternatively, Iran may be more flexible with granting access to the disputed sites now that it has achieved victories at the Security Council and potentially also had several additional months to clean up or remove nuclear items it does not want the IAEA to see.Just prior to the visit, AEOI spokesperson Behrouz Kamalvandi said the IAEA wanted access to two nuclear sites, one in Tehran and the other near the central Isfahan province.“We have never said we will not grant access to the agency, but this will happen if such claims end once and for all,” he said, referring to claims that Iran was hiding its nuclear activities.This seemed to indicate Iran might grant access for guarantees about being left alone in the future from any nuclear archive related evidence obtained by the Mossad during a raid in 2018.

But some people scrambled to stock up on essentials in groceries and bakeries, a limited number of which were allowed to remain open.Police vehicles used loudspeakers to urge Gazans to abide by the lockdown.The health crisis came amid heightened tensions along the Israel-Gaza border, where Palestinians have been launching sporadic rocket attacks and incendiary balloons that have burned fields in southern Israel. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: \'36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b\' }).render(\'4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6\'); });Israel has responded with air strikes against Hamas positions."No war has ever forced the people into a strict curfew (but) a weak virus has confined two million in the Strip," Freih Abu Middain, a Gaza-based former justice minister, wrote on social media. "All of (Israel\'s) F-16s, missiles and tanks couldn\'t do that."Gaza\'s health ministry said the four COVID-19 cases were uncovered after a woman travelled to the West Bank, where she tested positive. It said it was carrying out contact tracing to stem the spread of the infection.The ministry said there have been 110 cases of the coronavirus inside border quarantine facilities and one death since the world pandemic began.Last month, the Gaza director of the World Health Organization, Abdelnaser Soboh, said the territory\'s health system could deal with only 500 positive cases at one time.'}, {'id': '4fa23a9e-ec25-11ea-8093-fdd8c08b34d7', '__typename': 'Article', 'createdAt': '2020-09-01T07:32:38.219Z', 'updatedAt': '2020-09-01T07:32:38.219Z', 'mercuryObj': {'title': 'UAE cancels Israel boycott, allows economic agreements', 'author': None, 'date_published': None, 'dek': None, 'lead_image_url': 'https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/t_JD_ArticleMainImageFaceDetect/462120', 'next_page_url': None, 'url': 'https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/uae-cancels-israel-boycott-allows-economic-agreements-state-news-agency-640366', 'domain': 'www.jpost.com', 'excerpt': 'Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi said the move will “bring economic and trade successes for both nations.” He called on other countries in the Middle East to follow the Emirates’ “brave path.”', 'word_count': 599, 'direction': 'ltr', 'total_pages': 1, 'rendered_pages': 1, 'source': 'www.jpost.com'}, 'url': 'https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/uae-cancels-israel-boycott-allows-economic-agreements-state-news-agency-640366', 'category': 'armiger', 'subcategory': None, 'absSum': None, 'title': 'UAE cancels Israel boycott, allows economic agreements', 'source': 'www.jpost.com', 'text': " United Arab Emirates President Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan officially scrapped an economic boycott against Israel, allowing trade and financial agreements between the countries in another key step towards normal ties, the UAE’s state news agency reported on Saturday.The president issued a decree abolishing a boycott law as part of “the UAE’s efforts to expand diplomatic and commercial cooperation with Israel, leading to bilateral relations by stimulating economic growth and promoting technological innovation,” the WAM news agency said.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praises the decision, calling it “an important step towards promoting prosperity and peace in the region.”Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi said the move will “bring economic and trade successes for both nations.” He called on other countries in the Middle East to follow the Emirates’ “brave path.”The announcement came as El Al prepared to operate the country’s first direct flight between Tel Aviv’s Ben-Gurion Airport and the UAE’s capital, Abu Dhabi, on Monday.An Israeli government delegation and top aides to US President Donald Trump, including his senior adviser Jared Kushner, special representative for international negotiations, Avi Berkowitz, Envoy for Iran, Brian Hook and national security advisor, Robert O’Brian are set to arrive in Israel on Sunday, and will be on the inaugural flight to the UAE the following day. The Trump peace team is expected to meet with Netanyahu, Defense Minister Benny Gantz, and Ashkenazi in Jerusalem. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });An administration official told The Jerusalem Post that they are expected to participate in trilateral meetings, with Israeli and Emirati delegations. From the UAE, the team will head to Qatar, Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia. An administration official said on Saturday that the team may visit Oman as well. On their way back to Washington, they are expected to stop in the UK to meet British officials for an update on recent developments in the Middle East. Israel and the UAE said on August 13 they would normalize diplomatic relations in a deal brokered by Trump that reshapes the order of Middle East politics from the Palestinian issue to the fight against Iran.Before the August 13 deal can be officially signed, details must be agreed on regarding issues such as the opening of embassies, trade and travel links.Israel’s Channel 13 TV said bilateral trade could initially be worth $4 billion a year, a figure it said could soon be tripled or quadrupled.Government officials did not immediately confirm that estimate.Agriculture Minister Alon Schuster said Israel was working on potential joint projects that could help improve the oil-rich Gulf nation’s food security, such as water desalination and crop cultivation in the desert.“With their money and our experience, we could go a long way,” he told Tel Aviv radio station 102 FM in an interview on Friday.Officials from the two countries recently said they were looking at cooperation in defense, medicine, tourism and technology.The decree announced on Saturday means UAE citizens and businesses will be free to do business with Israel.The two countries do not yet have official air links, and it was unclear whether Monday’s El Al flight would be able to fly over Saudi Arabia – which has no official ties with Israel – to cut down on flight time.El Al requested permission from Saudi Arabia’s Civil Aviation Authority to fly through their airspace.The Health Ministry is likely to declare the UAE a “green country” from which Israelis may return without having to self-quarantine.In May, an Etihad Airways plane flew from the UAE to Tel Aviv to deliver supplies to the Palestinians to help fight coronavirus, marking the first known flight by an UAE carrier to Israel.

I’m grateful for our strong partnership. Thanks to Omani Sultan Haitham bin Tarik Al Said for our steadfast friendship,” Pompeo wrote in an upbeat tweet from the Omani capital of Muscat on Thursday.In an earlier tweet, he said the two had discussed “the importance of building regional peace, stability and prosperity through a united Gulf Cooperation Council.”Pompeo arrived in the region in the aftermath of the dramatic announcement two weeks ago that Israel and the UAE planned to normalize ties. He visited Israel on Monday and the UAE on Wednesday.An Israeli delegation led by National Security Adviser Meir Ben-Shabbat plans to visit the UAE next Monday.There was media speculation that El Al would take the Israeli delegation and fly over Saudi territory for the first time. El Al denied the report.US National Security Council Adviser Robert O’Brien also plans to head to the UAE next week, together with US Special Adviser Jared Kushner, US Special Representative for International Negotiations Avi Berkowitz and Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });Pompeo also visited Sudan, Oman and Bahrain, which are expected to follow the UAE in normalizing ties with Israel. During his visit, however, none of them gave a nod in that direction.Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok on Tuesday said he was not mandated to normalize ties with Israel and asked that the issue not be linked to discussions with the US on the country’s removal from the list of state sponsors of terrorism.In Bahrain on Wednesday, Pompeo failed to secure a statement from Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa about normalized ties with Israel.The US is ready to assist in the normalization of ties between Bahrain and Israel if needed, a senior US State Department official said during the Bahrain leg of the trip.“If we can help facilitate normalization with Bahrain, we’re ready,” the official said.Khalifa said he welcomed US efforts to achieve the Israel-UAE accord, noting “the importance of re-doubling efforts to realize a just solution which utilizes peace as a strategic option to end the Palestinian-Israeli conflict,” state news agency BNA reported.Saeb Erekat, secretary-general of the PLO Executive Committee, tweeted his appreciation of Bahrain’s comments, thanking it for insisting that there must first be peace between Israel and the Palestinians, and only then can normalizing ties with the Arab world occur. This includes the idea of a two-state solution at the pre-1967 lines with east Jerusalem as its capital, he said.The Trump administration’s peace plan does not stipulate the pre-1967 lines.“We highly appreciate the position of HM King Hamad Bin Issa Al Khalifa of Bahrain,” Erekat tweeted. “We hope that Mr. Pompeo will use his hearing skills. End the occupation then normalization.”While in the Middle East, Pompeo was attacked by Democrats in the US for addressing the Republican National Convention from Jerusalem, which they said gave the appearance he was using his public office to campaign.There were also clear tensions with Israel, about the possible US sale of the F-35 military jets to the UAE.The trip also took Pompeo to countries that stand strong against Iran, a topic that was also part of discussions. It gave the appearance of a tightening alliance against Iran between the US, Israel and the Gulf States.During the trip, the US continued to suffer setbacks on the international stage to curb Iran’s nuclear program, as well as to halt its aggressive regional behavior and its ability to stockpile sophisticated arms such as ballistic missiles.On Tuesday, the UN Security Council’s president dismissed a US attempt to formally trigger a mechanism that would ensure that international sanctions against Iran were snapped back into place.Those sanctions were lifted in 2015 under UNSC Resolution 2231 to help secure the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, known as the Iran nuclear deal, to curb Tehran’s nuclear power. It was signed by the US, China, Russia, France, the UK and Germany.The US left the deal in 2018 but said it retained its rights as a permanent UNSC member to call for those sanctions to be put back in place should Iran not comply with the deal.Currently, Iran is enriching uranium above the limits set by the deal.On the last day of his trip, Pompeo tweeted that the UNSC president could not halt the snapback request.“Last week, the US triggered the 30-day process to restore virtually all sanctions on Iran after the Security Council failed to uphold its mission to maintain international peace and security. These sanctions will snap back at midnight GMT on September 20,” he wrote.“If any member of the Security Council introduces a resolution to continue sanctions relief, the US will oppose it. If no resolution is introduced, the sanctions on Iran will still return on September 20. That’s how UNSCR 2231 works,” Pompeo wrote.Reuters contributed to this report. "}]

The report quoted two sources in Lebanese intelligence, who mentioned recent Turkish efforts to bring weapons into northern Lebanon. “We are pretty worried about what’s going on. The Turks are sending an incredible amount of weapons into the north,” the website quoted its source as saying. These reports await confirmation, and Al Arabiya is of course a media source linked to Saudi Arabia – a state rival of Turkey’s. But the evidence for a broader Turkish effort to build influence and allies in Lebanon in recent months is considerable, and solid. As are the indications of a Turkish-controlled infrastructure emerging in Sunni northern Lebanon. Both fit with the broader pattern both of Turkish behavior and of broader regional realities. In terms of the former, Turkey is actively involved using both its own forces and proxies in the two fragmented Arab countries to Lebanon’s east – Syria and Iraq. The deployments in both countries already have the look of the long term about them, with clearly defined areas of control. Turkey is also active in Libya, where its backing of Fayez Sarraj’s government almost certainly prevented the fall of Tripoli to the forces of Gen. Khalifa Haftar earlier this year. To these areas add Turkey’s aggressive naval stance in the Eastern Mediterranean, and its active backing of Hamas in Gaza and the West Bank and of Islamist organizations in Jerusalem. All these add up to a strategy in which Ankara is seeking to emerge as the main strategic beneficiary of the chaos and fragmentation that has gripped much of the region over the last decade. Regarding broader regional realities, Iraq, Syria, Libya – and Lebanon – today are geographical spaces rather than states in the sense traditionally understood. Within these spaces, rival regional and global powers are competing for ascendancy. Turkey is a central player in the first three countries named. It would be surprising if it were not active in the fourth. Other regional players are paying close attention to Turkey’s belligerent stance. The Times this week reported Mossad head Yossi Cohen as telling Arab intelligence chiefs that “Iranian power is fragile... but the real threat is from Turkey.”In the countries mentioned above, Turkey seeks to leverage both its Sunni Islamist credentials to appeal to Sunni Arab populations, and where relevant its Turkic ethnicity to appeal to Turkic remnant populations in the Levant. Available evidence suggests that in Lebanon, a similar pattern is being followed. Turkey has been working slowly and assiduously, via NGOs and government relief organizations such as the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency – TIKA – (also active in Jerusalem), to establish its foothold in the country.  cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });A recent article by Mohanad Hage Ali at the Carnegie Middle East Center noted the arrest on July 4 of two Turkish and two Syrian citizens on a flight to Lebanon from Turkey. The four attempted to smuggle $4 million into the country. Lebanese Interior Minister Mohammed Fahmi claimed that the money was intended to finance street-level protests against the Lebanese government.Turkey’s activities appear to be taking place at the grassroots level, and to be centered around the northern city of Tripoli, an urban center for the Lebanese Sunni population. It is a conservative, religious place and a stronghold of Sunni political Islam. As such, the area is a natural focus for Turkey. The Akkar Governorate, home to Lebanon’s tiny Turkmen minority, is also an area of interest. \xa0A July 12 article by Nahla Nasir al-Din on the Asas website of former Lebanese interior minister Nohad Machnouk, accused Turkey of seeking to “occupy Tripoli,” and included details of alleged Turkish activities in these areas. The article contains a welter of detail on alleged Turkish activities in northern Lebanon. It named Gen. Ashraf Rifi, former head of the Internal Security Forces and former justice minister, as a collaborator with Turkish intelligence in Ankara’s efforts in this area. Nasir al-Din also names Bahaa Hariri, eldest son of murdered prime minister Rafik Hariri, as engaged in the Turkish intelligence’s project to create a network of grassroots religious and political organizations among Lebanese Sunnis in Tripoli. The purpose of the network would be for it to act as a tool for the advancement of Turkish influence in Lebanon, available to be mobilized and brought to the streets at the appropriate time. Nasir al-Din further claimed that direct links are maintained in Beirut between representatives of the ruling Turkish party, the Justice and Development Party (AKP), and the local Lebanese Muslim Brotherhood party, Jamaa Islamiya. A July 13 article by Firas al-Shoufi in the pro-Hezbollah Al Akhbar newspaper summed up the situation in the following terms: “Turkish activity in Lebanon takes many forms, all leading in one direction, which is to strengthen Turkish influence among the Sunni Muslims in Lebanon, specifically in the north, and to confront the already eroding Saudi-Emirati influence in the war of leadership of the ‘Sunni world’ raging between Saudi Arabia and its allies on the one hand, and Turkey and its allies on the other hand.” Shoufi named specific social welfare projects undertaken by TIKA in the Tripoli and Akkar areas, such as “opening roads, digging wells for drinking and irrigation water and providing food aid.” He further notes that “General-Director of the Sûreté Générale [Lebanon’s main internal security organization] Maj.- Gen. Abbas Ibrahim made a series of observations about the Turkish performance during a meeting of the Supreme Council of Defense, on the basis of the need for the Lebanese state to monitor what foreign parties do inside Lebanon. Ibrahim also contacted the Turkish ambassador in Beirut, Hakan Cakil, and asked him about Turkey’s relationship with groups carrying flags and engaging in social activism in the north, who carry out actions that threaten security and block roads.’Shoufi’s identification of the Turks moving into a vacuum left by the relative absence of the Saudis and Emiratis is of particular note. All the evidence cited in the various Arabic outlets cited above should be treated with some caution. It is not yet possible to draw a definitive picture of the details of Turkish activity in northern Lebanon. But the very fact that the issue appears able to raise the joint concerns of channels affiliated with or supportive of Saudi Arabia (Al Arabiya) and Iran/Hezbollah (Al Akhbar) indicates that something does appear to be going on. The fragile Lebanese sectarian balance has been shattered over the last decade by the entry of around one million overwhelmingly Sunni Syrian refugees. Their presence has reversed the previous sense of an inexorable rise of the Shia to ascendancy in Lebanon. Until now, however, no force has proven able to harness the potential Sunni power in Lebanon to its cause. The Saudi-supported March 14 Movement was vanquished on the streets of West Beirut by Hezbollah and Amal in May-June 2008. The Gulf Arabs appeared to have more or less conceded the country to the Iranians, content to allow Iran and its local franchise to deal with a collapsing economy and infrastructure. As of now, however, the first signs are emerging that Sunni Islamist Turkey is seeking to fill the vacuum, and to recruit the Lebanese Sunni street to its banner. Something is happening in northern Lebanon.

The Brooklyn-born Chabad rabbi in the United Arab Emirates has been helping to quietly build a Jewish community, which this month was able to emerge from its humble shadows.In a quiet suburb of Dubai, local Jews have congregated in the small villa that serves as their synagogue on Shabbat and festivals. That remained a closely guarded secret until this month’s historic normalization of relations between Israel and the UAE.The Jewish community started as an informal grouping that met on an ad hoc basis. In 2013, it developed into a formalized prayer group, which has conducted religious services for nearly every Shabbat and festival. Hundreds of residents and thousands of visitors have enjoyed the services over the years.Officially known as the Jewish Community of the Emirates (JCE), the Jewish community last February came together, drafted a constitution and appointed Ross Kriel as its first president and Rabbi Yehuda Sarna as its first chief rabbi.During a recent Zoom call with Israel’s minister of Diaspora affairs, Kriel said the Jewish community enjoys the steadfast support from local authorities.“It is wonderful to share this truth with the government of the State of Israel and the Israeli public,” he said. “We look forward to receiving [Diaspora Affairs] Minister [Omer] Yankelevich in the UAE and hope it will soon be possible for Israeli visitors to visit this beautiful country.”The Zoom call with the Israeli minister was “a day we will never forget,” Sarna said. “The first time a member of Knesset addressed the Jewish community in the UAE will be included in the history books.” cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });Duchman said he believes normalization with Israel is the beginning of a “new era not only for Jews in the UAE but for Jews around the world.”“While many Muslim countries look up to the UAE and see it embracing Israel, it will change the relationship of Jews and Muslims all around the world, from Golders Green [in London] to Brooklyn,” he said.The deal will change perceptions that both sides have had of one another for decades, Duchman said.“This is the opposite of the perceptions the community has had growing up of antisemitism, of synagogues closing, of that gap between the two peoples growing so much over the last 70 years,” he said. “So this is a huge deal to rebuild these bridges for the whole Abrahamic community.”Duchman has long dreamed of being a pivotal player in Jewish-Islamic relations. He already has done a lot despite his young age, having lived in the UK, Israel and Morocco before arriving in the Gulf state.“We’ve lived with Muslims through our history – Iran, Syria, Algeria, Mecca, so many countries – and we had a great history in the past,” he said. “I felt it was my duty to come and build those bridges.”Being among the Arab world’s Jewish communities is at the heart of the Chabad ethos. While many Jews in the region left and made aliyah upon the establishment of Israel, Chabad rabbis were sent to support those who chose to stay and helped ensure the communities not only survived but thrived.Duchman saw the results of this effort during his three years in Morocco, where he was part of youth programs and Jewish-Islamic outreach.But it is not only in the Emirates where his role is pivotal. In Bahrain, where there are fewer than 100 remaining Jews, he heads the Chevra Kadisha burial program and the country’s only Jewish cemetery. Five years ago, he conducted his first burial alone, which was a task that was not easy as a young rabbi, he said.Duchman is known internationally by his Chabad peers as a charismatic leader. Together with Sarna, he has taken the community out of the shadows.Last week, both rabbis and other representatives of the community held a Zoom call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to congratulate him on the success of the normalization deal.Rabbi Dovid Cohen, the director of Chabad South London Students and Young Professionals, said the Chabad hassidic movement was proud of Duchman for the work he has done in the Emirates.“This is very similar to the successes seen in the likes of Morocco and the former Soviet Union, where there are now over 500 centers,” he said. “Now, they are thriving Jewish communities.”The Dubai Jewish community is one of the most diverse in the world, reflective of the almost 200 nationalities calling the city home. Its members hail from Europe, the Middle East, South Africa and elsewhere. Prayer books are in several languages, including French, Spanish, German and Russian.The message of inclusivity and tolerance is what drives Duchman. “These people need a home, love, kaddish… I have to be here,” he said.In September, Duchman will receive his first rabbinic interns, four young men from the US, coming to learn about life among the Emirates community. He hopes it will be the first of many more.“It’s important rabbis should be in this region, see the UAE, feel the tolerance,” Duchman said. “After a month in the UAE, they take the experience back to their own community. Slowly, slowly, we can change the world.”When Duchman told his Brooklyn-based family he would be going on shlichus to the Emirates as a Chabad shliach, or emissary, they expressed some hesitation, fearful of sending their son into the unknown.Other than Bahrain, the modern Gulf was somewhat of a Jewish hinterland. Since then, Duchman has taken prominent members of the local Emirati community to meet his family in Brooklyn, and family members have visited the Emirates.It is through such powerful human connections that the kind of Jewish-Islamic relations he has dreamed of are coming to fruition, breaking down prejudices and stereotypes and building meaningful dialogue and connection.Life has changed greatly. In those early years, Duchman would discreetly wear his kippa forward on his head when in public, which, coupled with his traditional hassidic beard, allowed him to pass more as Laith (an Arabic name) than Levi.Now, The K Kitchen, a kosher catering company in Dubai, can be called Elli’s Kosher Kitchen; in the Armani Hotel in the world’s tallest tower, the Burj Khalifa, there is an Instagram account called @kosherdubai; and kosher wine has just been given the green light to be imported to the Emirates. Emirates Airline has kosher food provided by Chabad of Thailand.This is just the beginning. An Abrahamic Family House in Abu Dhabi, slated for completion in 2022, will house a mosque, church and synagogue, which is said to be the most expensive synagogue ever built.The community’s newfound freedom has been patiently awaited for some time. It was announced last year that Israel would have a pavilion at Expo 2020 – now postponed until 2021. Israeli athletes have been allowed to compete in the UAE capital.Solly Wolf, one of the leaders of the local Jewish community, has been in the Emirates for 20 years after first coming via his connections with the country’s rulers, to whom he sold textiles. The peace accord was unique, he said, because unlike other Arab countries, there are no memories of war between Israel and the UAE.“Here, it was only a media and political ‘war,’” Wolf said. There is much scope for the community to grow now, not only attracting business, tourism and scientific and technical collaboration, but a genuine sense of its becoming a destination for Jews to feel safe, he said.“It’s not been an easy process,” Wolf said. “But now, I can imagine that within the next few years, the community will grow in the thousands.” "}, {'id': 'ff64e8f4-ec26-11ea-8093-fdd8c08b34d7', '__typename': 'Article', 'createdAt': '2020-09-01T07:44:42.593Z', 'updatedAt': '2020-09-01T07:44:42.593Z', 'mercuryObj': {'title': "Iran, Hamas and Islamic Jihad call for 'uprising' after UAE-Israel deal", 'author': None, 'date_published': None, 'dek': None, 'lead_image_url': 'https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/t_JD_ArticleMainImageFaceDetect/460551', 'next_page_url': None, 'url': 'https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/iran-hamas-and-islamic-jihad-call-for-uprising-after-uae-israel-deal-639735', 'domain': 'www.jpost.com', 'excerpt': 'A PIJ rep said that the “Zionist regime... will remain an enemy" and that its destiny "is destruction and decay, and whoever has a relationship with it will be transferred to the dustbin of history."', 'word_count': 423, 'direction': 'ltr', 'total_pages': 1, 'rendered_pages': 1, 'source': 'www.jpost.com'}, 'url': 'https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/iran-hamas-and-islamic-jihad-call-for-uprising-after-uae-israel-deal-639735', 'category': 'armiger', 'subcategory': None, 'absSum': ['The Middle East needs an uprising similar to the Islamic Revolution in Iran, PIJ representative says.', 'PIJ is a Palestinian group but often acts as an Iranian proxy.', 'Although it is made up of Sunnis, it has adopted Iran’s Shi’ite iconography.'], 'title': "Iran, Hamas and Islamic Jihad call for 'uprising' after UAE-Israel deal", 'source': 'www.jpost.com', 'text': " The Middle East needs an uprising similar to the Islamic Revolution in Iran that will unite the “resistance” of the Islamic community against a “culture of defeat” that has affected Arab regimes, Palestinian Islamic Jihad’s representative to Iran recently said.Mehr News in Iran reported the discussion with Naser Abu Sharif of PIJ, which is backed by Tehran. Hamas representative Khalid al-Qaddumi was also present, the report said.The Mehr News discussion attacked the “betrayal of the UAE in the signing of the agreement to normalize relations with the Zionist enemy.” Qaddumi said the agreement has crossed a redline and Israel is now more secure than in the past.The extremists asserted that Israel was like a criminal running free without anyone to put it on trial. He pointed out that when Egypt had signed a peace deal with Israel, the Arab League had suspended Egypt and moved its headquarters temporarily from Cairo. Egypt was readmitted to the Arab League in 1989.Hamas is outraged, the representative told Iran.“Nations and our educated class have a great responsibility in questioning friendly countries for normalizing relations.” He said the “Zionist regime is an enemy and will remain an enemy. The destiny of the [Zionist] regime is destruction and decay, and whoever has a relationship with it will be transferred to the dustbin of history.”The PIJ representative connected the current state of affairs in the Arab world to the era of 1979 prior to the Islamic Revolution, adding that the region needs a revolution like the one brought by Muhammad’s grandson Imam Hussein, who is venerated by Shi’ites. PIJ is a Palestinian group but often acts as an Iranian proxy. Although it is made up of Sunnis, it has adopted Iran’s Shi’ite iconography in these statements. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });“Today, the American project is a project of infidels,” said Abu Sharif. “Unfortunately, the Arab governments are being won over by the projects of the United States and the Zionist regime… the governments are corrupt without exception.” He called for a revolution in the region against the recent trend of normalization of ties.Overall, the comments appear to represent desperation on behalf of Iran and its allies among the Palestinians. The attempt to try to rekindle a revolutionary spirit like in 1979 or to encourage the Arab League to react as it did then is far-fetched.The interview nevertheless represents Iran’s attempt to spread slander against the UAE and also to encourage discord and protests in the region. So far there have been few protests against the UAE-Israel agreement.

And then there were the critics: Iran, Turkey, Qatar, Hamas, Hezbollah and others. Their rants say something about what kind of world they want to see," before going on to highlight analyses by the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) and the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), showing that the main critics had been linked to three sources: Iran, the Palestinians, and Qatar. The MEMRI report quoted Saudi journalist Mishari al-Dhaidi praising the agreement between the UAE and Israel, comparing it to article in the Qatari daily Al-Sharq, titled "...This Is How The Palestinian Cause Became A Pawn In The Hands Of Bin Zayed." In that article, the Qataris harshly criticized the UAE for describing Hamas as a terrorist organization, and for accusing Hamas of holding the people of Gaza hostage. "In this context, it is impossible to ignore the UAE\'s campaigns of maligning and renouncing the Palestinian cause," the article read. Meanwhile, a report for the ADL by David Andrew Weinberg noted: "Peace always has its opponents, and this agreement is no exception. [...] The vast majority of these materials [criticizing the deal] come from media outlets linked to one of three sources: Iran (or its proxies), the Palestinians, and Qatar.\xa0 Although the subset of these examples linked to Iran tends to be the most extreme, certain materials from all three places seem to be fundamentally hostile to Israel or propagate intolerant stereotypes."

An important element of the deal for the UAE is the expectation that its citizens would be able to visit the Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem.Lahav Harkov and Omri Nahmias contributed to this report. '}]

What can Israel get in return?', 'source': 'www.jpost.com', 'text': " Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu can deny as much as he likes, but it seems like it’s a done deal: the advanced F-35 stealth fighter jet will likely be in the hands of pilots from the United Arab Emirates in coming years.In a press conference in Jerusalem on Monday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington will continue to supply Abu Dhabi with technical and military assistance, like they have over the past two decades.“We will continue to make sure we are delivering them with the equipment that they need to secure and defend their own people from this same threat,” he said, referring to Iran. He nevertheless stressed that “the United States has a legal requirement with respect to qualitative military edge, and we will continue to honor that.”Though Washington has been selling Abu Dhabi millions in military deals, they have been bound to preserve Israel’s qualitative military edge (QME) in the Middle East before selling any advanced weaponry to regional states.US President Donald Trump’s administration has said the normalization agreement between the UAE and Israel could allow the Gulf state to clinch unspecified new US arms sales, and the UAE, which is among the world’s biggest defense spenders, is currently in the process of building up its armed forces.But it might not only be the UAE that ends up requesting Washington sell them the advanced jet.So might the other Arab countries that have signed peace accords with Israel: Jordan and Egypt, the latter of which might already face American sanctions for its recent $2.5 billion purchase of 4.5 generation SU-35 fighter jets from Russia, since Washington won’t sell them the F-35s. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });And what about Saudi Arabia? Will the possibility of getting such jets be that last push the kingdom needs to sign a similar normalization deal with the Jewish state?Since Pompeo has said Washington will continue to make sure Israel retains its QME, what can or will Israel demand in return for the UAE receiving F-35s.Will it be the F-35B short takeoff/vertical landing (STOVL)?Israel has expressed interest in the past in acquiring the F-35B, which has the capabilities for vertical takeoff and landings, an option that can allow the jet to land on much shorter runways if the IAF’s bases are attacked by Iranian jets or missiles from Hezbollah.But, a senior Israel Air Force officer who was personally involved in the decision to purchase the F-35s told The Jerusalem Post recently that the disadvantages of the plane are greater than the advantages.“It can extend the range of the air force and gives more opportunities that would enlarge the operational envelope of the IAF, but it carries fewer weapons,” he said.So what about the V-22 Osprey?The IAF is also once again looking at procuring Boeing’s V-22 Osprey despite budgetary issues, as it believes there is an operational need for between 12-14 aircraft that can take off and land like helicopters but fly like fixed-wing planes.The multi-role combat aircraft uses tiltrotor technology, combining the vertical performance of helicopters (such as takeoff and landings) with the speed, altitude and range of fixed-wing planes, making them the ideal aircraft for sensitive missions since they don’t need runways.But the UAE also wants the V-22, so we can rule out that purchase to retain Israel’s QME.Maybe the F-22 Raptor?The F-22 is an advanced tactical fighter aircraft developed for the US Air Force and is considered the first 5th-generation fighter after it entered service with the USAF in 2005.Using low observable technologies and modern avionics, the F-22 has been designed to rapidly project air dominance with stealth and range. The supersonic jet can be armed with an M61A2 cannon, six AIM-120 AMRAAMs, two AIM-9 Sidewinders, two 1,000-pound GBU-32 Joint Direct Attack Munitions and two AIM-120s.Flown only by the USAF, if sold to Jerusalem the F-22 can without a doubt maintain Israel’s QME in the Middle East.But maybe Israel doesn’t need aircraft to keep it’s QME, what about advanced heavy weaponry like the GBU-57A/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator or the GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB)?The MOAB, nicknamed the Mother of All Bombs, is considered the largest non-nuclear bomb in the USAF’s inventory and was used only once against Islamic State terrorists, dropped on a deep tunnel complex in eastern Nangarhar Province in Afghanistan.Both bunker busters are in use only by the US and would provide Israel with the ability to effectively destroy Iranian infrastructure deep underground.Selling the F-35 to the UAE would reduce Israel’s regional superiority – especially if other Arab countries follow suit. But there are several options available and more will likely come up that Washington can sell Israel to maintain it’s QME.It’s not the end of Israel’s reign of power in Middle Eastern skies.

He became acting leader after Badie’s arrest in August 2013.An interior ministry statement said Ezzat had been arrested from an apartment used as a hide-out in Cairo’s Fifth Settlement district, and was accused of joining and leading a terrorist group and receiving illicit funds. Egyptian authorities accuse the Brotherhood of promoting militancy and subversion, accusations it strongly denies.The interior ministry said encrypted communications equipment had been seized during the arrest, and said Ezzat was suspected of overseeing several assassinations or attempted assassinations as well as a bombing since 2013.Ezzat had previously been sentenced to death and to life in prison in absentia. According to Egyptian law, he will face retrials in the cases following his arrest. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });A picture distributed by the interior ministry and published by Egyptian newspaper Al-Youm al-Sabaa showed a gaunt and frail looking Ezzat wearing a striped T-shirt. After then-army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi led the 2013 overthrow of former President Mohamed Mursi, a Brotherhood figure who was Egypt’s first democratically elected leader, the group has been outlawed and much of its leadership jailed.Other senior members of the group have left the country, with many now living in Turkey, and media reports had previously placed Ezzat abroad.Badie remains in prison in Cairo, where he has received several life sentences. Mursi died after collapsing in a prison courtroom in June 2019.

The report quoted two sources in Lebanese intelligence, who mentioned recent Turkish efforts to bring weapons into northern Lebanon. “We are pretty worried about what’s going on. The Turks are sending an incredible amount of weapons into the north,” the website quoted its source as saying. These reports await confirmation, and Al Arabiya is of course a media source linked to Saudi Arabia – a state rival of Turkey’s. But the evidence for a broader Turkish effort to build influence and allies in Lebanon in recent months is considerable, and solid. As are the indications of a Turkish-controlled infrastructure emerging in Sunni northern Lebanon. Both fit with the broader pattern both of Turkish behavior and of broader regional realities. In terms of the former, Turkey is actively involved using both its own forces and proxies in the two fragmented Arab countries to Lebanon’s east – Syria and Iraq. The deployments in both countries already have the look of the long term about them, with clearly defined areas of control. Turkey is also active in Libya, where its backing of Fayez Sarraj’s government almost certainly prevented the fall of Tripoli to the forces of Gen. Khalifa Haftar earlier this year. To these areas add Turkey’s aggressive naval stance in the Eastern Mediterranean, and its active backing of Hamas in Gaza and the West Bank and of Islamist organizations in Jerusalem. All these add up to a strategy in which Ankara is seeking to emerge as the main strategic beneficiary of the chaos and fragmentation that has gripped much of the region over the last decade. Regarding broader regional realities, Iraq, Syria, Libya – and Lebanon – today are geographical spaces rather than states in the sense traditionally understood. Within these spaces, rival regional and global powers are competing for ascendancy. Turkey is a central player in the first three countries named. It would be surprising if it were not active in the fourth. Other regional players are paying close attention to Turkey’s belligerent stance. The Times this week reported Mossad head Yossi Cohen as telling Arab intelligence chiefs that “Iranian power is fragile... but the real threat is from Turkey.”In the countries mentioned above, Turkey seeks to leverage both its Sunni Islamist credentials to appeal to Sunni Arab populations, and where relevant its Turkic ethnicity to appeal to Turkic remnant populations in the Levant. Available evidence suggests that in Lebanon, a similar pattern is being followed. Turkey has been working slowly and assiduously, via NGOs and government relief organizations such as the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency – TIKA – (also active in Jerusalem), to establish its foothold in the country.  cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });A recent article by Mohanad Hage Ali at the Carnegie Middle East Center noted the arrest on July 4 of two Turkish and two Syrian citizens on a flight to Lebanon from Turkey. The four attempted to smuggle $4 million into the country. Lebanese Interior Minister Mohammed Fahmi claimed that the money was intended to finance street-level protests against the Lebanese government.Turkey’s activities appear to be taking place at the grassroots level, and to be centered around the northern city of Tripoli, an urban center for the Lebanese Sunni population. It is a conservative, religious place and a stronghold of Sunni political Islam. As such, the area is a natural focus for Turkey. The Akkar Governorate, home to Lebanon’s tiny Turkmen minority, is also an area of interest. \xa0A July 12 article by Nahla Nasir al-Din on the Asas website of former Lebanese interior minister Nohad Machnouk, accused Turkey of seeking to “occupy Tripoli,” and included details of alleged Turkish activities in these areas. The article contains a welter of detail on alleged Turkish activities in northern Lebanon. It named Gen. Ashraf Rifi, former head of the Internal Security Forces and former justice minister, as a collaborator with Turkish intelligence in Ankara’s efforts in this area. Nasir al-Din also names Bahaa Hariri, eldest son of murdered prime minister Rafik Hariri, as engaged in the Turkish intelligence’s project to create a network of grassroots religious and political organizations among Lebanese Sunnis in Tripoli. The purpose of the network would be for it to act as a tool for the advancement of Turkish influence in Lebanon, available to be mobilized and brought to the streets at the appropriate time. Nasir al-Din further claimed that direct links are maintained in Beirut between representatives of the ruling Turkish party, the Justice and Development Party (AKP), and the local Lebanese Muslim Brotherhood party, Jamaa Islamiya. A July 13 article by Firas al-Shoufi in the pro-Hezbollah Al Akhbar newspaper summed up the situation in the following terms: “Turkish activity in Lebanon takes many forms, all leading in one direction, which is to strengthen Turkish influence among the Sunni Muslims in Lebanon, specifically in the north, and to confront the already eroding Saudi-Emirati influence in the war of leadership of the ‘Sunni world’ raging between Saudi Arabia and its allies on the one hand, and Turkey and its allies on the other hand.” Shoufi named specific social welfare projects undertaken by TIKA in the Tripoli and Akkar areas, such as “opening roads, digging wells for drinking and irrigation water and providing food aid.” He further notes that “General-Director of the Sûreté Générale [Lebanon’s main internal security organization] Maj.- Gen. Abbas Ibrahim made a series of observations about the Turkish performance during a meeting of the Supreme Council of Defense, on the basis of the need for the Lebanese state to monitor what foreign parties do inside Lebanon. Ibrahim also contacted the Turkish ambassador in Beirut, Hakan Cakil, and asked him about Turkey’s relationship with groups carrying flags and engaging in social activism in the north, who carry out actions that threaten security and block roads.’Shoufi’s identification of the Turks moving into a vacuum left by the relative absence of the Saudis and Emiratis is of particular note. All the evidence cited in the various Arabic outlets cited above should be treated with some caution. It is not yet possible to draw a definitive picture of the details of Turkish activity in northern Lebanon. But the very fact that the issue appears able to raise the joint concerns of channels affiliated with or supportive of Saudi Arabia (Al Arabiya) and Iran/Hezbollah (Al Akhbar) indicates that something does appear to be going on. The fragile Lebanese sectarian balance has been shattered over the last decade by the entry of around one million overwhelmingly Sunni Syrian refugees. Their presence has reversed the previous sense of an inexorable rise of the Shia to ascendancy in Lebanon. Until now, however, no force has proven able to harness the potential Sunni power in Lebanon to its cause. The Saudi-supported March 14 Movement was vanquished on the streets of West Beirut by Hezbollah and Amal in May-June 2008. The Gulf Arabs appeared to have more or less conceded the country to the Iranians, content to allow Iran and its local franchise to deal with a collapsing economy and infrastructure. As of now, however, the first signs are emerging that Sunni Islamist Turkey is seeking to fill the vacuum, and to recruit the Lebanese Sunni street to its banner. Something is happening in northern Lebanon.

He wants elections, and he has critiqued the “political class” that is entrenched in power. Lebanon is facing a major “danger,” he said over the weekend.This comes as the country chooses a new prime minister and government and as French President Emmanuel Macron is again scheduled to visit.Rai has called for the state to confine all weapons under its control and that of the army, Abu Dhabi-based Al Ain News online reported. This comes after armed clashes with Hezbollah supporters last week, as well as concerns that the terrorist group is storing 150,000 rockets and munitions throughout the country.In response, pro-Hezbollah voices have slammed the Maronite leader, claiming he is supporting “peace” and is linked to Israel. This is an attempt to link him to the UAE-Israel deal and make it appear as if he supports “normalization.”In fact, the stance of those around Rai is that Lebanon should not be part of regional conflicts; it is Hezbollah that has hijacked Lebanon and forced it to be part of the “resistance” against Israel.Unsurprisingly, the increased tension and lack of government leadership has put religious leaders at the forefront. The Maronites are the traditional Christian leaders of Lebanon. But they also found themselves at the forefront during the civil war in the 1970s and ’80s, and many of their leaders have been assassinated. In addition, the president of Lebanon is always a Christian, and the current president, Michel Aoun, is also pro-Hezbollah. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });This potentially puts the patriarch in the crosshairs of conflict. Fifteen years ago, Hezbollah members plotted and carried out the murder of former Lebanese prime minister Rafic Hariri. A UN investigation accused four Hezbollah members and found one guilty last month.Rai’s criticism of illegal weapons caches in recent weeks is controversial and could put him on a collision course with Hezbollah. He has been treading carefully in the wording of his sermons and speeches in this respect.But Lebanon is often a powder keg. In addition, many regional countries want to inflame tensions in the small country sandwiched between Syria and Israel.

(res.) Amos Yadlin, former IDF intelligence chief and currently head of the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), spoke to Nissim Mashal on his 103FM radio show on Friday and discussed the tension in northern Israel relating to the Hezbollah organization. According to Yadlin, the Lebanese terrorist organization understands that it can\'t touch civilians, but "is determined to kill IDF soldiers." Yadlin said that "Hezbollah won\'t dare touch civilians, and it\'s trying to change the rules so it\'s allowed to hurt IDF soldiers. We must be loud and clear and make it understand that we won\'t play this game."\xa0 \xa0The INSS head addressed the recently growing concerns of a Hezbollah attack. "I believe Nasrallah is determined to kill IDF soldiers. He is looking for a focused blow that won\'t necessarily cause an escalation. He\'s failed three or four times already, and he\'s not giving up. "There\'s a big similarity between the northern and southern borders and there are also differences," he explained. "On both fronts, there\'s a delicate dialogue going on, trying to determine the equation and the rules of the game. No one on either side wants to reach a full-scale confrontation. The difference is that in the South, civilians are being attacked and the IDF needs to make sure that it stops. Hamas is extorting us," Yadlin said. Unlike the situation with Hamas, Yadlin says that "in northern Israel the rules are a bit different – the civilians are safe. Hezbollah knows that it can\'t touch civilians but it\'s trying to harm IDF soldiers. It\'s trying to tell us: \'You can\'t attack the Iranian establishment in Syria. If by chance a Hezbollah terrorist is hurt in Syria, you\'ll pay the price.\' "What am I concerned about? I think they\'re succeeding," he said. "Since July 20, I\'ve seen around seven aircraft reaching Hezbollah from Syria or Iran, probably with ammunition, and Israel is not attacking."  cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: \'36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b\' }).render(\'4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6\'); });WHEN ASKED why it looks like the powerful IDF is afraid of a conflict with a terrorist organization, Yadlin said that "on a strategic level, the IDF\'s reluctance to retaliate against the terrorist on Har Dov is interpreted by Nasrallah as weakness and may lead him to make a larger gamble that will lead to escalation. "I think we were wrong not to at least publish the documentation of the terrorist arriving," he said. "It would be fine to let them leave once, but as soon as it\'s clear that Nasrallah keeps reading us in the wrong way, the IDF must do what its chief of staff keeps preaching: achieve a crushing victory. Which will explain to Hezbollah that this game it\'s playing is not acceptable – and it will surely not cripple us in our efforts of preventing Iranian establishment in Syria."Regarding the attack on Hezbollah\'s weapons and ammunition warehouses in Lebanon, Yadlin emphasized: "This is the most important discussion that the national security cabinet needs to ask itself, but it\'s busy with other issues, which also don\'t lead to any decisions. "For 15 years, the slandered war in Lebanon achieved a very good situation in northern Israel," he said. "Civilians are protected. There are 14-year-old children in Kiryat Shmona that have never seen a shelter. Hezbollah is trying to change the rules and make IDF soldiers its new targets. We need to be clear in saying that we won\'t accept that."Yadlin concluded the interview by sharing his opinion on how the IDF should respond and determine ground rules that will make Hezbollah understand that initiating an offensive operation is not worth it. "We keep signaling that we don\'t want to reach a third Lebanon war, but there\'s a delicate balance between not doing anything and providing encouragement. Hezbollah made a mistake in 2006 and it may make another one. At this point, we\'re escalating the situation more than containing it," Yadlin said. Translated by Tobias Siegal.

Either way the Middle East is changing - analysis', 'source': 'www.jpost.com', 'text': " Is it a peace deal or a normalization deal?It is a question many people have been wondering over the last two weeks, ever since Israel and the United Arab Emirates announced a historic deal to formalize diplomatic relations between the two countries.On the one hand, peace would make sense. The UAE is an Arab country in the Middle East, and like many others, it has rejected acknowledging Israel’s existence until now.On the other hand, how can there be peace when there was never war? For there to be peace between countries, they would have first needed to have been hostile with one another.Thankfully, that was never the case between Israel and the UAE. Yes, the UAE refused to publicly open diplomatic ties with Israel. But it never fought Israel, like in the case of Egypt and Jordan, two countries that fought multiple wars against the nascent Jewish state with the declared goal of destroying it.When deals were reached with both – Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994 – those accords heralded in an era of peace. Weapons were put down, border crossings were opened, and embassies were established.With the UAE, there are no weapons that need to be laid down. Jerusalem and Abu Dhabi have never been at war and have never had an openly hostile relationship. Unlike Egypt, which fought Israel in 1948, 1956, 1967 and 1973, the UAE has never fired a missile at Israel or threatened its existence. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });This difference is exactly why no matter what you call it, the deal with the UAE has the potential – for the average Israeli – to mean a lot more than the previous peace deals with Jordan and Egypt.While Israel’s peace with Jordan and Egypt are both pillars of stability for the Middle East – they have enabled Israel to downsize its defense budget, to invest in other areas and to focus on other threats – they mostly manifest on a government-to-government level.When it comes to people-to-people, though, there is very little exchange, very little tourism (except for the Sinai) and very little trade (except now for gas).With the UAE, there is no bad blood. There is no bad history. The PLO didn’t find refuge there and use it to launch attacks against Israel, like in Jordan, and its military forces didn’t fire artillery shells at Israeli communities, like from Egypt. Instead, it is a country with which Israel can start a clean slate and build a new alliance.While Israelis have gotten used to the cold peace with Jordan and Egypt, the relations that were being built in Abu Dhabi during the historic visit on Monday are expected to be warm between two nations whose peoples are already looking forward to respectively visiting and investing in Dubai and Tel Aviv.And who knows? Maybe the warm ties that Israel establishes with the UAE will trickle across the region to the average Jordanian and Egyptian. So, whatever you call what is happening, it doesn’t make that much of a difference. The Middle East is changing before our eyes.

Jordan was also invited, but King Abdullah declined unless Palestinian Authority Mahmoud Abbas was included; Israel agreed to invite Abbas. A PA official, however, told JNS that they will not attend as part of their continued boycott of Washington.Schneier said Saudi Arabia would have to be the country to lead the way for other states along the Persian Gulf when it comes to the Trump peace plan.“There’s a regional balance of power,” he explained. “In order to affect a real change, the Saudis would need to meet with the Israeli prime minister.” cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });In addition, “just as the Saudis led a peace initiative in 2002, it would only be natural for them to be at the forefront of [the new US] peace initiative and mediate between the Israelis and Palestinians,” Schneier said.The Saudis are “pleased that the process has been resurrected by the Americans,” the rabbi added.They also expressed concerns that the plan must meet “minimal standards” for a Palestinian state and the status of Jerusalem.Riyadh “offered a plan almost 20 years ago, and I remind them that it took the Israelites 40 years to get to the Promised Land. It’s not going to happen overnight. I think people appreciate it’s a process,” Schneier stated.As the leader of the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding, Schneier visits Gulf states several times a year for interreligious dialogue, but is also a major proponent of establishing relations between Israel and those states. Schneier is an official adviser to the king of Bahrain and works with the emir of Qatar, as well as the leadership in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

We don\'t recognize you," a passerby shouted at him as he inspected the shattered neighborhoods. Another offered to shake hands with Adib, who wore a facemask as Lebanon battles COVID-19.The explosion, caused by what authorities say were 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored at the port, led to the resignation of the previous government, now acting as caretaker.UNDER PRESSURESince October, the crisis has sunk Lebanon\'s currency, locked savers out of deposits held by a paralyzed banking system and fueled poverty and unemployment. The root cause is decades of corruption and waste overseen by a political elite.Macron\'s visit coincides with Lebanon\'s centenary, at a time of profound doubts that it has a future as a viable state under the sway of former warlords and sectarian leaders loyal to different regional masters, Iran and Saudi Arabia.Macron made a series of phone calls to Lebanese leaders at the weekend that were vital to securing consensus on Adib."It was the pressure of his calls to everyone, the pressure of his coming to Lebanon, the pressure of everyone not wanting to upset him," a senior Lebanese politician said.A French presidency source said Macron was demanding "a government of mission, clean, efficient, able to implement the necessary reforms in Lebanon."Macron told journalists on Friday that the exceptional moment facing Lebanon led him to increase pressure."France has convinced its European and American partners and a good part of the regional partners that we are honest brokers," he said.Adib\'s name surfaced on Sunday when he was nominated by former prime ministers, including Saad al-Hariri who heads the biggest Sunni Muslim party. Under the Lebanese system, the post of premier must go to a Sunni.Hariri\'s Future Movement and the powerful Iranian-backed Shi\'ite party Hezbollah were among those nominating him.With Hariri\'s backing, Adib will enjoy more support than Hassan Diab\'s outgoing government, nominated by Hezbollah and its allies which together have a parliamentary majority.Lebanon won pledges of more than $11 billion in support at a Paris conference in 2018 conditional on reforms it failed to carry out.'}, {'id': '4b1f0f90-ec27-11ea-8093-fdd8c08b34d7', '__typename': 'Article', 'createdAt': '2020-09-01T07:46:49.642Z', 'updatedAt': '2020-09-01T07:46:49.642Z', 'mercuryObj': {'title': "Senior al-Qaeda commander planning attack arrested by Yemen's military", 'author': None, 'date_published': None, 'dek': None, 'lead_image_url': 'https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/t_JD_ArticleMainImageFaceDetect/460652', 'next_page_url': None, 'url': 'https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/senior-al-qaeda-commander-planning-attack-arrested-by-yemens-military-640482', 'domain': 'www.jpost.com', 'excerpt': "The Yemeni official said that the terrorist was coming from the central province of Ma'rib to carry out a terror operation in the capital.", 'word_count': 330, 'direction': 'ltr', 'total_pages': 1, 'rendered_pages': 1, 'source': 'www.jpost.com'}, 'url': 'https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/senior-al-qaeda-commander-planning-attack-arrested-by-yemens-military-640482', 'category': 'armiger', 'subcategory': None, 'absSum': ['Yemen has been wracked for more than five years by a civil war pitting the Iran-aligned Houthi movement that controls much of the country and a Saudi-led coalition.', "The ongoing war have already killed tens of thousands of Yemenis, have made immense damages on the country's infrastructure."], 'title': "Senior al-Qaeda commander planning attack arrested by Yemen's military", 'source': 'www.jpost.com', 'text': " An al-Qaeda commander was arrested in Yemen on Saturday while he was planning a terrorist attack in the capital Sana'a, according to the Tasnim News Agency.

There are also plans to enhance capabilities for cloud computing. “When we put this infrastructure in schools, it allowed all the other students to come with computers,” he told The Media Line. “We call it BYOD – Bring Your Own Device. This is the physical infrastructure.”Yet for Dan Ben-David, president and founder of the Shoresh Institution for Socioeconomic Research and a professor in Tel Aviv University’s Public Policy Department, providing computers to students from sectors with fewer resources, such as the Arab and ultra-Orthodox communities, is not enough. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });“Just giving kids a computer doesn’t mean you are enabling them to use them by providing the internet and the technical support and everything else they need,” Ben-David told The Media Line. “There’s a major lack of preparedness in that regard.”The latest data for Israel from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) shows that in 2017, 22% of the country’s households did not have at least one working personal computer, and 25.9% lacked internet access.Meanwhile, more than 100 high school and college-aged students from abroad are scheduled to arrive in Israel on Sunday for the fall semester at Alexander Muss High School in Hod Hasharon, east of Tel Aviv. After landing at Ben-Gurion Airport, they will be transported to the school’s campus where they will undergo the required two-week quarantine. “Students will bring their own laptop computers from home,” Dr. Mark Shinar, the head of Alexander Muss, told The Media Line, adding that each classroom was equipped with a desktop for teachers to use for remote learning, as well as several extra computers when needed. Efforts are also underway outside Israel to provide pupils lacking key equipment or services.On Tuesday, Oman’s Sultan Haitham bin Tarik announced via the official Oman News Agency that he was ordering free laptops for low-income Omanis enrolling in colleges and universities for the academic year starting in September.About 17% of the Gulf state’s 43,000 higher education students registered for the fall semester will qualify.Shelly Culbertson, a senior policy researcher at the RAND Corporation who focuses on education in the Middle East, has a unique understanding of the challenges facing education systems in the region, having spent close to a decade working in Qatar, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. She says that in addition to the importance of internet and device penetration, a big challenge for the coming school year lies in training teachers to provide an online curriculum. “In the Middle East, teacher training has historically been very weak. In some countries, the qualification to be a teacher is an associate degree, not a bachelor’s degree,” Culbertson told The Media Line, adding that the ability of some teachers to use computers might be limited. She adds, however, that countries such as Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Israel are very sophisticated in terms of teacher-training and the provision of resources.Nevertheless, it is a very different story in places like Iraq.“I’ve done education work in Iraq. They don’t use the computer lab because they are afraid of breaking the computers,” she said, adding that they also “lack electricity.”Many students in the Middle East without remote-learning resources risk losing an entire school year. According to the United Nations, nearly 24 million pupils in 180 countries could also drop out due to the economic consequences of the coronavirus crisis.“It’s going to be a case of haves and have-nots coming out of the pandemic for the school year,” Culbertson said. “For a lot of kids in the Middle East, it’s going to be a lost year of education.”For more stories, go to themedialine.org "}]
